------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0 - (Monday, June 24th, 2002)
------------------------------------------------------------------------


• Chris Redfield walkthrough is fully complete.

• Separated the "Jill Valentine" and "Chris Redfield" walkthroughs into
  two different sections due to the massive size.

• Added some more questions to the FAQ section; one about what happens
  if you use the Red Gemstone in the Tiger Altar Room.

• Put in some additional details about the "One Dangerous Zombie".

• Fleshed out the "Game Endings" section...it's now finished.

• Added in several extra gameplay details from a reader contribution.
  That person has also been added to the credits.

• Spellchecked everything and fixed a bunch of annoying errors.

• This guide is now 100% complete!


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8 - (Saturday, June 22, 2002)
------------------------------------------------------------------------


• Chris Redfield walkthrough is up to when you get back to the "Mansion"
  for a second time.

• The "Files Transcript" is complete...mainly due to the fact I got
  Minesweeper's permission to borrow info from his. ;)

• Created a "Contact Information" section (standard section from now
  on). Didn't want too...really DIDN'T want too, but it seems some
  people need to be baby-sat when using email! Just hope they don't
  stick a fork in an electric outlet...

• Moved the "Important Legal Information" to the beginning of the guide.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.5 - (Monday, June 17th, 2002)
------------------------------------------------------------------------


• Walkthrough for Chris Redfield is about halfway complete for the first
  "Mansion" section.

• Added the "Cute Critters" and "Secrets and Easter Eggs" sections to
  the guide; which respectively are an enemy list and information that
  covers stuff you can unlock.

• I've started the dreaded "Files Transcript" section -- BRING on the
  tedium! Boy do I need some sleep right about now, too tired... 

• Fleshed out the "Weapons" section making it fully complete. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0 - (Monday, June 3rd, 2002)
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Yah know, at first I was quite surprised to see a FAQ/Walkthrough for 
this game at 400 KB+. But silly me, than I realized they just copied a 
normal Jill walkthrough twice, and changed some details on the second 
one to make it work for hard mode! Then they added a Speed Guide -- but 
get this -- from a reader contribution! Hohoho. Now I know what 
marshmallow was talking about when he wrote for Perfect Dark...OH well, 
if somebody passes this over for a larger guide, so be it...

• Jill Valentine's walkthrough is now FULLY complete! Time to start on
  Chris Redfield. Didn't want to get left behind and look like a
  complete fool! You know what the funniest part is? My time on
  the game I used to write the Jill walkthrough -- 53:37:26 -- bahaha!
  Besides, I better finish this FAQ up before I get cracking on Eternal
  Darkness...

• Started up the "Frequently Asked Questions" section. This might even
  keep my email down to sane levels.

• Added a little trick about blowing off the legs of Zombies in the 
  Survival Tactics section. Discovered it while tooling around the
  Laboratory with a Grenade Launcher. :p 

• Added the "Self defense gun", "Assault Shotgun", "Magnum Revolver",
  and "Barry's 44 Magnum" to the Weapons section. 

• The next version of this guide will be listed under my new soon-to-be
  contributor name "mayonnaise," so don't freak out when the guide
  supposedly disappears.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.7 - (Monday, May 13th, 2002)
------------------------------------------------------------------------


• It's been a week already?! Completed the "Courtyard" and "Residence"
  parts of Jill Valentine's quest. Took a lot less time then I thought
  it would, actually, but God that J-VOLT thing took a while to write
  up... 

• Added an alternative strategy for beating Yawn the Python, thanks to a
  GREAT reader contribution. 

• Fixed some errors in the "Herb Chart" in the Survival Tactics section.

• Added the "Flash Grenade" and "Flamethrower" to the Weapons section.

• Fixed a terrible spacing error, there should be NO horizontal scroll
  bar at the bottom of the screen anymore. This should ease the
  headache of those with low-resolution monitors.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.5 - (Monday, May 6th, 2001)
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Even though I bought this game a mere six days ago, I must have already 
logged in at LEAST 30 hours; I want to stop playing, but it's just so 
addictive! It's going to be quite difficult to pry myself away from the 
game to write this guide. 

The game basics are complete, and I suggest you check them out, as I 
spent a substantial amount of time trying to make that section as 
detailed as possible. The walkthrough is complete for the first 
"Mansion" part of Jill Valentine's quest, and the weapons section is 
started up. I'll probably play for another week before sending in 
another version. But hey, you never know, I might actually get ambitious 
and decide to update before then...

S.T.A.R.S. Investigation Helicopter Missing!!
-------------------------------------------------


Arclay Mountains, Raccoon City, 24th


A spokesperson at the Raccoon City Police Department reported that an 
investigation helicopter of the special task force S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team 
is missing.

According to the announcement from the Raccoon City Police Department, 
the team was sent to investigate the Arclay Mountain and Raccoon forest 
area, where a number of people have been reported missing. Contact with 
the team has been lost since the last communication before dawn. 

The Raccoon City Police Department suspects the team has been involved 
in some trouble. Now it will send the S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team to 
investigate and collect information from witnesses. 

Recently there have been a number of bizarre murders reported near 
Raccoon City. This incident is likely to make Raccoon City residents 
feel even more uneasy. 

The special task force S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Service) 
was founded in 1996 under control of the Raccoon City Police Department 
to counteract increasing city terrorism and other crimes. 


    -- From Raccoon Press evening issue, July 24, 1998

The controls are quite sluggish in this game, and take practice to use 
effectively. But in all seriousness, the controls should only give you 
trouble if you haven't played the original RE. Even then, it should only 
take about 15 minutes to acclimate yourself, and they get to be REALLY 
intuitive after about an hour of play. 

Expect to accidentally run into a zombie when you meant to shoot it, 
forget to switch between weapons, ect. I know, because it happened to me 
quite a bit at the beginning...stop laughing. But what would be the 
point if you could run away from Zombies at 50 MPH? 'Type A' control is 
default, but feel free to experiment between the three control schemes. 

                                •  •  •

Know the Difficulty
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Normal Mode --  I. MOUNTAIN CLIMBING - beyond the hardships lies
                accomplishment.  

Easy Mode   --  II. HIKING - the destination can be reached rather
                comfortably. 

There's also a few secret difficulties, but let's not get into that yet.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Your Map
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


The map is very useful in this game, so use it often. A few notes on the
icons found on it:


DOORS
---------

• Red are locked.
• White are unlocked.
• Blue are doors you've been through.

ROOMS 
---------

• Faded/clear rooms you haven't visited yet.
• Orange rooms you have visited, but they're not complete (items left).
• White rooms are "complete" or "explored." 


And that little block with the arrow is you! The red arrow shows which 
direction your facing. Typewriters and Item Boxes are appropriately 
marked in with pencil, but you must find them first before they pop on 
the map. 

NOTE: Of course, you get to see an entire mansion floor after collecting
      a piece of Mansion Map, but let's leave that to the walkthrough... 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
The Status Screen 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Accessing this screen allows you to view your health, examine your item 
stock (right side; and the graphical details are AMAZING), and select 
which weapon you want to use. You can also set your defense item and 
read various files...which by the way, may range from interesting bits 
of background info to clues on where to go next.  


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Health
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


On the status screen, you should notice in the upper-left hand corner 
that lovely heart monitor, or "electrocardiogram." This measures your 
health, with green (fine), yellow (caution), and red (danger), along 
with the label turning purple for the special status (poison). Once you 
flatline, you're dead and die in a pool of blood, where appropriately 
enough, a "You Are Dead" screen pops up. Use health items, like herbs, 
to restore yourself to the "fine" condition, and remember, just a few 
Zombie attacks can make your health drop like lead...


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Saving the Game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


To save your game you need to find some Ink Ribbon (which looks like a 
small, circular black container), and then find a typewriter. After 
saving, one Ink Ribbon is used, so NO, you don't have unlimited 
saves...save only when you absolutely have too. This adds a new 
dimension of challenge to the game. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    S U R V I V A L   T A C T I C S
------------------------------------------------------------------------


1# -- "Survive the horror"


Resident Evil is part of the "survival horror" for a reason people. 
Zombies and other enemies are quite strong in this game (especially 
since Capcom ramped up the difficulty for this remake), so if you don't 
need to fight them, DON'T. Sounds simple, right? That is, until your 
stuck in a corner with three Cerberus (Zombie dogs) breathing down your 
neck. Use corners/terrain to shield you, or simply retreat to another 
room/area for safety.


Along with that, keep in mind...

• Dodging zombies is quite tough, but to gain maximum speed to get
  around them, try to run in as straight of a line as possible. Easier
  said then done, since the controls are less than forgiving. Geometry: 
  the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Watch
  out, as the Zombies will always reach out for you as you pass. And
  sometimes you may want to pop a cap in their chest to stun them so you
  can get around, or unload enough rounds to drop them to the floor.

• Listen carefully. Whenever Jill/Chris runs, they make footprint sound
  effects -- you should listen for enemy footprints according. This
  point is best illustrated in one of the first areas of the Courtyard,
  as you can hear the Cerberus pacing back and forth WAY before they
  attack you, allowing you too ready a Shotgun. Also listen for changes
  in music that indicate an enemy presence, along with enemy "moans"
  and room effects.  

• Check EVERYTHING, EVERYWHERE in a room. Press A like a madman, as you
  never know when you might stumble across some well hidden ammo, files,
  ect. You might even be entertained by some item's descriptions. ;)  

• Oh yea, get rid of the friggen "Survival" (oh brother) Knife as soon
  as you can, it's 99.9% USELESS. You should use it only once in the
  entire game, but that's in the walkthrough.


2# -- "Conserve ammo, least you be stranded"


Ammo is EXTREMELY valuable in this game, so don't waste it! Enemies take 
many bullets to die, and if you run out of ammo, you've also run out of 
luck...unless you actually enjoy tooling around with that "sweet" 
Survival Knife. Easy mode seems to have plenty of clips, though, so it 
depends on your game. Guess easy mode is easy, hyuk hyuk. Which leads me 
too the next point...


3# -- "Multiple saves equals double the pleasure, double the fun"


Even though Ink Ribbons are quite precious, you still have five 
different slots to save in. If I were you I would create multiple saves 
(two is fine, maybe even three if you have room) for a single game in 
case you screw up. Certain points are very difficult.


4# -- "When in doubt, push"


If you happen to see any waist-high objects, or suspicious furniture, 
don't be afraid to push them. Remember they can go left-right and 
forward-back. This is the key to finding some well hidden items and 
advancing in the game.   


5# -- "Defense items are your friends"  


Daggers, Stun Gun, and the like. But, just like your friends, you DON'T 
want to abuse them. Defense items in this game are valuable, so uh, 
don't run into zombies. :p The best part is they take up no space in 
your inventory, so think of them as freebies. Of course, if the Zombie 
ends up grabbing you from behind you're pretty much screwed...but we 
wouldn't let that happen, will we? Of course not. 


6# -- "Use herbs, and not the cooking kind"


Herbs come in planted pots or terraces found throughout the game. Keep 
at least one Green Herb with you (if you have room), as you never know 
when you're health will drop like a sack of potatoes. Here's some herb 
explanations and a chart to help you out -- •combining• herbs together 
has extra effects.


Green Herb -- Heals physical ailments.
Red Herb   -- Does nothing alone, but once combined with Green Herbs can
              boost their effects.
Blue Herb  -- Heals the poison status ailment.  


.-------------------------.
|        HERB CHART       |
|-------------------------|
|  Green  |  1/3 Health   |
|  Red    |  nothing      |
|  Blue   |  Poison Cure  |
|---------'---------------|-------------------------------. 
|  Green + Green          |  2/3 Health                   |
|  Green + Green + Green  |  Full Health                  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
|  Green + Red            |  Full Health                  |
|  Green + Blue           |  1/3 Health and Poison Cure   |
|  Green + Green + Blue   |  2/3 Health and Poison Cure   |
|  Green + Red + Blue     |  Full Health and Poison Cure  |
'-------------------------'-------------------------------'


NOTE: It's probably MUCH better to combine a red and Green Herb, rather
      then a green and green if you want more health. For one thing, you
      get full heal rather then 50%, and it's better to have spare Green
      Herb then red. Red Herb is COMPLETELY useless alone. 


7# -- "Intelligence counts"


It may be a survival horror game, but this Resident Evil game has MANY 
puzzles in it, usually involving finding an item, and delivering it to 
the appropriate spot. But luckily, most of the puzzles are pure logic 
(oh no, guess that counts out most people) and just require you to 
observe your surroundings, and take note of ANYTHING that may be a clue.


8# -- "Go for the glitter"


Whenever there's an item that needs to be picked up, it should sparkle 
like a diamond. Keep it mind though, that many items have no glitter, so 
check anyway. Remember that fully completed rooms (as in all items 
collected and objectives completed) show as white on the map.

• Dead-end paths are notorious for non-glitter items. I mean, why create
  a dead-end unless something is there?


9# -- "Zombies 101"


You're basic zombie isn't too bright. But that doesn't matter, because 
he's a bastard to kill and has a taste for human flesh, namely, your 
flesh. While he's lumbering at you, you can fill his body with some 
Handgun rounds if you want to bring him down. But once he drops the 
first time, no, no, don't think he's gone. He'll get right back up and 
come straight for you again. Once he's down, AND a pool of blood forms 
around the body, you're safe for the time being. But just you wait, 
eventually that Zombie carcass is going to get up again, when you least 
expect it, only as a Crimson Head.


To permanently dispatch of your undead comrade, you can:

• Head removal. Make sure to blow off his head in a bloody mess while
  he's still lumbering after you; this takes PRECISE aim, and I'm rarely
  able to do it, but it only takes one shot.    

• Incineration. Have a Lighter and a FILLED Fuel Canteen with you. Next,
  stand near the body of the Zombie laying on the floor, and use your
  canteen. Get back, as it's barbecue time, extra crispy style. Nothing
  like the smell of partially dehydrated, trans-mutanagenic hair in the
  morning.      

These two methods were also covered in the "Body Disposal" file you find 
in the East Stairs Storage Room in the Mansion. 


• And sometimes, if a Zombie is blocking you way, but you have no fuel
  to burn'um, pop a few caps in there hide to drop them to the floor
  momentarily allowing you to pass. Just be careful not to kill them...

• Sometimes when you shoot a Zombie in the legs you might make his
  kneecap explode -- kinda hard for him to chase you now as a Crimson
  Head! Use this method when trying to kill a Zombie...unless you're
  good at getting headshots.


And I have to add a paragraph about the special super-zombie, nicknamed 
"Crimson Head" or as called in the medical files, "V-ACT." Like normal 
Zombies, except the Crimson Head will run straight at you kamikaze 
style, then attempt to rip off your face with his claws. Recommended 
antidote is a Handgun blast to the face or a few well-placed Shotgun 
shells. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
MORE TO SAY:

(from Toadman527@aol.com)


"As for using the survival knife, you should dump it as soon as 
possible. However, before you get a chance to dump it, I found a good 
use. If a zombie falls to the ground, but isn't dead, you can take out 
the knife and poke them at least once, maybe twice before they get up. 
This only saves a bullet or two, and isn't very practical to do the 
whole game, but ammo counts, so it's worth a try."


Another great technique for Hard mode!

Most people new to the game will first play as Jill, and with good 
reason. Getting through the game is MUCH easier as Jill Valentine, as 
not only does she have the Lock Pick, she's also got EIGHT inventory 
spaces to hold items...these two facts will be painfully reminiscent 
when you try your hand at Chris. Jill also has the Grenade Launcher!

OPENING
-----------

After watching the GREAT cutscene with a forest and a pack of mutant 
guard-dogs, the remaining S.T.A.R.S. team members heed safety in an old, 
dilapidated mansion. This is where the "fun" begins...

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

There's three of you left: Barry, Wesker, and yourself, Jill Valentine. 
After a shot goes off, you and Barry head into the adjacent room to 
check it out...

DINING ROOM
---------------

Nothing much here, except grab the INK RIBBON sitting upon the table in 
front you, then save at the TYPEWRITER at your side. Head down the 
long table to fireplace, where Barry has found a blood stain (notice how 
he tastes it to check it out!). Take the door on the side.

KENNETH HALLWAY
-------------------

Head left, where we meet up with a Zombie having his midnight snack. 
Um...guess we caught him at a bad time? After gaining control turn 
yourself straight around and enter the Dining Room again.

DINING ROOM
--------------- 

The Zombie has followed Jill, but Barry quickly pumps him full of a few 
Magnum rounds and it drops to the floor. Time to report back to Wesker! 
Head along the table and exit out the double doors. What was that "moan" 
you heard as you left? :p   

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Crap. Wesker is gone, just like Chris went missing a few minutes ago. 
Barry decides we need to look for Wesker, so he searches the ground 
floor, while you're •supposed• to search the upper floor (LOL). Just 
trot up one set of stairs, then turn around and come right back down. 
You've "searched." Barry and Jill decide to split up, and you get the 
LOCK PICK from him (this will come in HANDY). After Barry goes off to 
the Dining Room again, take the double doors on the opposite side...

NOTE: If you take the double entrance doors, some Cerberus will be
      waiting on the porch for you, and Jill will get scared and quickly
      shut the door -- but not before a dog comes in after you. This is
      quite a nuisance if you have no Shotgun, and, you don't.   

STATUE ANTEROOM
------------------- 

Yes, that IS a sparkle you just saw in the vase part of the statue. Run 
past the statue, over to where a dresser is partly blocking a side 
passage. Push it right SLIGHTLY, so you can squeeze into the corridor, 
then turn around and push the dresser TOWARDS the statue. Climb up, and 
press A to get the glitter...the F1 MANSION MAP. 

Hop down from the dresser, then take the side corridor; we've got some 
old art supplies and things covered in tarp. At the end of the corridor, 
grab the DAGGER. Turn around, but when you go around the corner a Zombie 
"ambushes" you. God this is easy. Just get around it (even if you mess 
up, you just end up using the dagger). Don't bother wasting the ammo 
killing the thing. Exit the corridor, then exit back to the Foyer.

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Dun dun dun. Most all of the doors are locked (except two). Head up the 
stairs, then take the double doors on the left side.

DINING BALCONY ROOM
-----------------------

Circle around left, and watch yourself, a Zombie is on the right. Push 
the statue forward, then off the ledge where the gap in the railing is. 
It'll hit the floor below and shatter. Circle around to the left side, 
avoiding the Zombie, and grab the DAGGER on the shelf. Exit to the foyer 
again. 

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Head downstairs and enter the Dining Room yet again. 

DINING ROOM
---------------

Nothing's here, not even Barry like he supposed to be...except remember 
the statue we pushed off the balcony upstairs? Run to the shatter debris 
and pick up the BLUE GEMSTONE. We'll use that MUCH later (it's not 
really a required item, but quite handy). Exit to the hallway.

KENNETH HALLWAY
-------------------

The Zombie's up and about, but to your right, and is moving about 1 
friggen MPH. Head left, and examine the dead body of your comrade, 
Kenneth (I named it "Kenneth Hallway" for a reason). You get a VCR tape 
file, but you can't view it yet. Exit out the end door.

FAR WEST STAIRS 
--------------------

Head around the darkened corner, and in the next chamber is a HANDGUN 
MAGAZINE sitting beside the bird cage...there's a dead raven in it, 
spooky. Ahem. Grab a GREEN HERB at the foot of the chairs, but only if 
you need it, then head up stairs and exit. 

YELLOW CORRIDOR
-------------------

A dead body's in front of you, and you'd better torch it in the future 
unless you want a Crimson Head running around. Cross in front of the 
mirror beside you, and watch out, a Zombie is just around the corner. 
Dodge him and run down the hall with the spears. Grab that sparkle 
sitting on the statue, the GOLDEN ARROW. There's also a HANDGUN MAGAZINE 
resting on the floor beside the mirror. Exit out the door just beside 
the mirror.

DINING BALCONY ROOM
-----------------------

Watch the Zombie, and exit out the double doors to the foyer again. 

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Head down the stairs, and right where the stairs branch in two different 
directions, there's a "hidden" (cough) door to exit out of.

GRAVEYARD
-------------

This area is where GameCube's lighting abilities come in handy, the fog 
really sets the mood and makes it look like more then just pre-renders. 
Head down the steps, turn the corner, head down some more steps, then 
follow the path straight to the end. Examine the Angel Statue, which 
suspiciously has an Arrowhead-shaped hole on it (duh, duh). On your 
status screen examine the Golden Arrow and Jill will find she can remove 
an ARROWHEAD, which you should then use on the statue to open a secret 
passage. Head down the stairs...

CRYPT
---------

An eternity later, you'll be at the bottom, in a creepy crypt room 
complete with roaring furnaces, some gears, and a coffin suspicious 
suspended by chains. Run underneath the coffin (don't worry, it wouldn't 
open) and check the pedestal to get the BOOK OF CURSE. Examine the back 
of the book, and you'll find a Mansion Key lodged in its back cover. If 
you check the key itself, and you should see a sword symbol on the 
"handle" of it -- the SWORD KEY. Wooo. The Book of Curse is then filed 
away, and what it's talking about is those four face statues lining one 
of the Crypt walls...remember that later, when you have to come back 
here. Exit out of here.

GRAVEYARD
-------------

Enter the foyer again.

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Take the double doors on the right again. 

STATUE ANTEROOM
-------------------

Run over to the door, and open it up using the Sword Key. 

KITCHEN CORRIDOR
--------------------

Run forward, and make sure not to freak out when the window PARTLY 
shatters. That scared me the first time. :p Push the first china cabinet 
forward to uncover a DAGGER. Head around the corner, then at the end 
push the last china cabinet away from the door to get a MUCH needed 
HANDGUN MAGAZINE. Exit through the door...

NOTE: If you backtrack through here •backwards•, some Cerberus will bust
      through the windows and attack. So this is a BAD IDEA. 

EAST WINDOW CORRIDOR
------------------------  

Take the door on your left, and Jill uses the Lock Pick. Time for some 
fresh air...

SIDE GARDEN
---------------

There's more Cerberus, but they're safely outside the gates.

NOTE: If you come back here in the future, expect some Cerberus to be on
      you quickly. Plan accordingly by bringing a Shotgun.

Head around the corner, and grab the plastic bag in the wheelbarrow, 
some CHEMICAL. Once you examine it, it's renamed HERBICIDE, which should 
give you a hint on it's use (kills plant life). Grab some herbs, but 
ONLY if you can leave a space open in your inventory. Head back inside.

EAST WINDOW CORRIDOR
------------------------

Enter the room next door...

BATHROOM
------------

The bathtub's full of dirty water, so examine it, and pull the plug. A 
zombie pops out (gee surprise) and attacks Jill...on her ankles. She 
delivers a swift blow to his head to end it, then proceeds to vomit in 
the nearby toilet. All in a days work...examine the tub again for a 
DAGGER then get outta here.

EAST WINDOW CORRIDOR
------------------------

Head around the corner, pass some windows, then go around another corner 
and enter the door.

QUAINT LITTLE ROOM
----------------------

Cross over and enter the next room.

ANTIQUE ANTEROOM
--------------------

If you examine the coffee table, you'll find a DAGGER on one end and 
some precious INK RIBBON on the other. At the back wall, grab the 
SHOTGUN sitting on the two hooks...which looks like they trigger a 
switch. ;) Exit out.

QUAINT LITTLE ROOM...OF DEATH
---------------------------------

Immediately after entering, Jill is confounded with the fact the ceiling 
is lowering, and about to crush her into a Jill sandwich (snicker). Turn 
around and check one door (locked), run across and check the other door 
(locked also), then run to the center of the room. Jill is saved in the 
nick of time by Barry. WHERE'S MY "JILL-SANDWICH" LINE BARRY?!?! 

EAST WINDOW CORRIDOR
------------------------

Head through the double doors. 

EAST HALLWAY
----------------

Take the first side door on your left...

BOTTOM OF EAST STAIRS
-------------------------

Head along the hallway, but immediately off to your right is a Zombie. I 
•strongly• recommend killing him off (with your Handgun), since the 
"stairs" areas are some of the most frequently traveled in the game. 
Take the door you find here at the bottom of the stairs.
  
EAST STAIRS STORAGE ROOM
----------------------------

Ah, safety. This room is completely safe, and has a ITEM BOX and a 
TYPEWRITER for you. Grab the FUEL CANTEEN sitting right of the Item Box,
then the "Body Disposal" file on the floor in front of the box. Read 
that file, know it, love it. Also grab the HANDGUN MAGAZINE sitting on 
the crates with the lamp. 

Run over to the Typewriter, and beside it you should notice a plastic, 
white tank. This is a KEROSENE TANK, which you should use to fill the 
Fuel Canteen you just picked up. This fuel, used with a Lighter (you get 
it soon) allows you to burn Zombie bodies so they don't come back to 
life as Crimson Heads. Save your game, then deposit any superficial 
items. You basically just need a Handgun and some ammo, your Shotgun, 
and maybe a Green Herb (there's one right outside, under the stairs).  

BOTTOM OF EAST STAIRS
-------------------------     

Head up the stairs to the top...

EAST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

Off to your right a Zombie will greet you, so pump him full of lead, 
then run past his corpse and exit the door at the end (the other door 
has no doorknob...hyuk). 

DILAPIDATED BROWN HALLWAY
-----------------------------

Head left, and enter the door at the end.

STUDY
---------

Directly beside you, collect the DOG WHISTLE sitting on the dresser. You 
also get a "crumpled memo" which reveals what you should do with it -- 
summon a dog who hangs around the west, second floor balcony; apparently 
he's got something special hidden in his collar. Beside the chess board 
is a HANDGUN MAGAZINE. Head to the next section in the room, and pick up 
the LIGHTER sitting on the desk. Beside it is a "Book of Botany" (file) 
you also want to pick up. Exit out the other door. 

EAST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

Before continuing on, you NEED to have your Shotgun, Handgun, Handgun 
ammo, Sword Key, and Dog Whistle. Get rid of the Lighter in the Item Box 
down stairs, and make SURE you have at least 2 spots open in your 
inventory. Take the door at the end on your right again.

DILAPIDATED BROWN HALLWAY
-----------------------------

All the other doors are locked, so just turn right and run all the way 
to the door at the end, where you head through using your Sword Key. 

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Jill startles Barry who just happens to be strolling through here, and 
they chat for a bit. "Other than I'm still alive in this mad house...? 
No." Classic line right there folks. :p Barry gives you some ACID SHELLS 
(upgraded Grenade Launcher ammo) and then you part ways. 

NOTE: If you didn't have any room in your inventory, the conversation
      with Barry would have been much shorter, and you wouldn't have
      gotten the Acid Shells. Which sucks, really.  

Head to the other side of the foyer and use the double doors again.

DINING BALCONY ROOM
-----------------------

Head around the left side (the Zombie is on the left side now!) and open 
up the second side door using your Sword Key.

WEST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

Turn to you right and open up the first door (Jill uses her Lock Pick). 

OUTSIDE TERRACE BALCONY
---------------------------

OK, prepare yourself for some heavier fighting. Use the GREEN HERB 
TERRACE on that side area if you need health. Remember that terrace, and 
don't waste it later in the game healing on stupid things. Head along 
the balcony edge until you reach the area where the balcony widens. Trot 
down the stairs and get in the center of the wide area. Make sure you 
have your Shotgun equipped, and you're facing the left (direction you 
just came from). Blow your Dog Whistle. 

Seems Lassie and his little friend have come for a visit! Blow them away 
with your Shotgun (sey h'llo t'my lil' friend!) and collect the COLLAR 
from the one dog. Examine the Collar on your status screen -- look at 
the buckle -- and you'll find a switch. Push it and out pops a COIN. 
Sure looks suspicious...examine the back of it to find an armor 
insignia, and transform the Coin into IMITATION OF A KEY.    

Continue along the balcony, going to the other end and unlocking the 
door. DON'T go out it. Head back to the other end of the balcony and 
exit out the door you came from. 

WEST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

Head directly forward and exit out the door.

DINING BALCONY ROOM
-----------------------

Take the door right beside you.

YELLOW CORRIDOR
-------------------

Turn the corner, head down the spear path. Dodge this Zombie yet again, 
then pass around the mirror. Head right, going down that hallway piece  
and exit out the door (Crimson Head will appear from that body, scary).  

KNIGHTS' HALLWAY
--------------------

Head up the stairs. This cramped hallway has three •suspicious• Knight 
statues along it, all with inscriptions relating to death. Find the 
pedestal with the key in it and inspect it. 

"May whoever takes this emblem find peace in death."

Take the Mansion Key...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               KEY PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

First "real" puzzle of the game, and it's easy, to say the least. After 
taking out the key from the pedestal, place in your Imitation of a Key. 
The whirling-blade knight will retreat and the surroundings will return 
to normal. Wow...that was hard...wait, no.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examine the Mansion Key -- the ARMOR KEY! The door at the other end is 
locked, so turn straight around, and head down the stairs. Exit out the 
door at the bottom.

YELLOW CORRIDOR
-------------------

Run straight ahead and exit out the other door.

FAR WEST STAIRS
-------------------

Head down the stairs -- don't be alarmed at that noise, just some creepy 
crows on the pole. Guess they're here to avenge the death of their 
friend in the cage. Round the dark corner and exit out the door.

KENNETH HALLWAY
-------------------

Head into the narrow hall, and if the Zombie is ahead of you (as in, you 
didn't kill him yet), use only enough bullets to drop him, as we don't 
want a Crimson Head running around. Unlock the second door on the left 
with your Armor Key (don't go in) then continue on, passing the inactive 
lift and heading down the stairs. Open the door with your Sword Key, and 
then discard it. 

KITCHEN
----------- 

Nothing much is here, just grab the DAGGER at the edge of the food table 
and the HANDGUN MAGAZINE on the table corner. There's another lift 
around the corner, but it's also inactive. Exit out the door you came 
in. We have a nice little cutscene of a Zombie (what else?) coming down 
that stairs and confronting you in the kitchen. Could this get any 
friggen easier? Dodge the thing and leave. 

KENNETH HALLWAY
-------------------

Head up the stairs, and take the door on the left that leads to the 
Dining Room.

DINING ROOM
---------------

Run along the table and exit to the foyer...

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Head up stairs, and take the double doors on the left.

DINING BALCONY ROOM
-----------------------

Head around right, and take the second door. 

WEST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

The door to the terrace is shaking. Wonder what it could be? :p Ignore 
it and run past (it wouldn't burst open...yet). Head around the stairs 
and then turn the corner. Take out the Zombie you find. Trot to the top 
of the stairs, where the terrace door will burst open, revealing another 
Zombie -- take no heed. Head down the stairs, and midway take out 
another Zombie with some Handgun rounds. Run back up, and take out the 
Zombie who's coming for you. Danger is over, for now, and I can stop 
typing "Zombie" every two seconds. Head down the stairs to the bottom...

BOTTOM OF WEST STAIRS
-------------------------

Enter the door off to the side.

DRUG ROOM
-------------

Drugs as in medicines...cough. ;) This room is just like the other "save 
room" on the opposite side of the mansion, complete with TYPEWRITER and 
ITEM BOX. Definitely SAVE your game. Before you leave, get rid of any 
items you don't need, just make sure leave the two inventory spots open 
and have a Handgun, Handgun ammo, Shotgun, Herbicide, Armor Key and the 
Blue Gemstone (told you we'd use it). Exit out of here...

BOTTOM OF WEST STAIRS
-------------------------

Head around the corner, then down the hall with the windows. Take the 
side door...

FURNITURE STORAGE CLOSET
----------------------------

We got a KEROSENE TANK here...but grab the INK RIBBON in the desk 
drawer, and the BATTERY PACK on the edge of the other dresser. Ignore 
that BROKEN SHOTGUN sitting in the case, unless, you like cluttering 
your inventory...leave. 

NOTE: You may want to take some time and burn all those Zombie bodies
      littering the stairs area. Crimson Heads is something we don't
      need around here.

BOTTOM OF WEST STAIRS
-------------------------

Take the door directly beside you.

LONG WINDOW HALLWAY
-----------------------

Grab the BATTERY PACK sitting on the desk beside you...yah, that's the 
shadow of a Zombie knocking at the window, but you're safe from it for 
now. Head right, going down the hall, then turn left and enter that tiny 
side hall. Go through the door...

TIGER ALTAR ROOM
--------------------

Tiger Statue with a suspicious inscription. Guess you could say it's 
suspicious. :p

Use the Blue Gemstone, and Jill will place it in the statue's right eye, 
causing it to turn and reveal some SHOTGUN SHELLS. Just what we needed! 
Grab them then leave.

LONG WINDOW HALLWAY
----------------------- 

Head across the hall and exit through that door.

KEEPER'S ROOM
-----------------

What happened here?! Grab the HANDGUN MAGAZINE on the bed, and head 
around...did that closet door just move? Anyway, go to the desk and read 
the HILARIOUS file of the Keeper's Diary. Brace yourself -- turn around 
and the closet doors should fling open, revealing a Zombie. Use what 
little space you have to maneuver around him, then grab the DAGGER in 
the closet. Get around the bed -- WATCH OUT -- that other Zombie came 
alive as well. Get outta here...

LONG WINDOW HALLWAY
----------------------- 

Turn right, and head down the hall, round the corner and pass the 
windows, then enter the door at the end.

NURSERY
-----------

We have a bunch of plants here, of course, and a water pump in the 
corner beside where you enter. If you head forward a little, you can see 
a giant "vine-ish" plant that engulfs a fountain. If you go around the 
first planter you'll get whipped by one of his vines, so be careful. 
Head to the water pump, and use your Herbicide...Jill places the bag in 
the water. Now examine the pump and say "yes" you want to pump the 
water. PUMP TO THE RED SIDE. 

The fountain will turn on, spurting out a colorful red water and kill 
off the vines (don't freak out when they suddenly jerk upwards). The 
threats over, so head to the other side of the Nursery -- we have some 
Green Herbs on some planks, but more importantly, grab the DEATH MASK 
sitting on the shield. Examine it to get MASK W/OUT EYES. Exit out. 

NOTE: If you pump to the •green• side, the Herbicide-laced water will be
      sprayed on the pots of Green Herbs and wither/KILL them, rendering
      the things useless.

SECOND NOTE: It's rather obvious where the water leads. Just check the
             red and green pipe lines leading from the pump -- one
             clearly goes left and the other to the right. 

LONG WINDOW HALLWAY
-----------------------

The Zombie is not at the window...run forward...SHATTER. Keep running 
and dodge the Zombies as they fly out of the windows (must be Jackie 
Chan Adventures; they take some time to get up). Turn right, and run 
down the hall to the end, unlocking the door and heading through. 

KENNETH HALLWAY
-------------------

We basically went in a circle. Take the door back to the Dining Room.

DINING ROOM
---------------

Exit to the foyer.

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Now, we're going to finish up unlocking doors with the Armor Key; 
there's four left in total. Head up the stairs, and at the top, head to 
the right side (side with two single doors). Unlock the door in the far 
corner with your Armor Key. Don't enter, head to the other door on this 
side and exit out.

DILAPIDATED BROWN HALLWAY
-----------------------------

Unlock the door just ahead of you. Head around the corner, then unlock 
metal double doors. Keep going, then take the first side door to the 
stairs.

EAST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------
Run forward, go around the corner, then head down and open the side door 
with your Armor Key. One left to go! Head down the stairs.

BOTTOM OF EAST STAIRS
-------------------------

Take the door at the end of the hall piece.

EAST HALLWAY
----------------

Trot around the chair, and watch that Zombie around the corner! Unlock 
the final door in the corner with your Armor Key...discard it. Enter 
through the door.

PORTRAIT GALLERY
-------------------

OK, we have another puzzle here, and this one is actually •puzzling•. 
Without my help, you might actually have to try it two, maybe even three 
times. ;)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             PORTRAIT PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Along this hallway are six portraits, and at the end is a portrait of 
Lisa, whom is guarded by the "three spirits." If you notice carefully in 
the picture, Lisa is wearing a GREEN CROWN, PURPLE NECKLACE, and ORANGE 
BRACELET.

The six portraits along the hall consist of: 

• 2 Valiants, which wear bracelets 
• 2 Sages, which wear necklaces
• 2 Saints, which wear crowns

Each picture has a switch on it, which can be used to light a certain 
color. You need to light a Valiant orange, a Sage purple, and a Saint 
green. Keep the rest of the lights off. Easy, no?

If you mess up at any time, the crows perched on the rails will let you 
know...hoho. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Press the switch on the Lisa portrait and head outside, grabbing the 
DEATH MASK. Examine it, it's the MASK W/OUT MOUTH. Lock Pick the gate 
and head out...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW SCIENTIFIC:

(from Toadman527@aol.com)


"First, the puzzle with the "pictures" and lights to get a death mask 
doesn't involve pictures, those are glass windows. You are mixing the 
light on either side."


I'm still calling it "Portrait Gallery" though! :p
------------------------------------------------------------------------

GRAVEYARD
-------------

Head up the stairs, entering into the Mansion Foyer again.

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Head up the stairs to the RIGHT. Take the single door in the far corner.

GARDEN BALCONY
------------------

We have a little glass greenhouse going on here, so exit out, and pass 
the glass table. Head around the corner, there's some more plants, and, 
the DEAD BODY of your S.T.A.R.S. teammate Forest. But it's not all bad, 
pick up his GRENADE LAUNCHER! Sch-weet. Make sure to arm yourself with 
this new piece of hardware and head around the last corner. Forest comes 
alive and paces at you! Hit him with a few grenades and the "fight" is 
over. You have access to some Green Herb at the end here. Before 
leaving, grab the DAGGER sitting on the side of the brown bench. Exit 
out of this area...

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Take the door just beside you.

DILAPIDATED BROWN HALLWAY
-----------------------------

Head forward and take the first door on the right.

RICHARD HALLWAY
-------------------

Run forward, where you're greeted by a fellow S.T.A.R.S. member, Richard 
Aikens. He's been bitten by a snake -- unfortunately, it was poisonous. 
We need to retrieve some Serum for him before you passes away...yea, 
you're officially the errand girl for the time being. Make it over to 
the Drug Room in the west side of the mansion (hey, it's on you're map, 
and it's just the save room at the bottom of the stairs, besides, you 
even get that nice color photo). And don't THINK I'm writing room by 
room to walk you over there. Lazy.

DRUG ROOM
-------------

Once here, check that medicine cabinet beside the Item Box to get the 
SERUM. Also deposit the masks away and MAKE SURE TO GET your Lighter, 
you'll need it soon. And have two spots open in your inventory. Leave 
here, then head back to Richard. Seconds count!

RICHARD HALLWAY
-------------------

Give the Serum to Richard and he's cured! Wooray. Head through the next 
door around the corner. 

NOTE: If you take too long delivering the Serum to Richard, you'll find
      him dead in a crumpled mass on the floor. 

ATTIC HALLWAY
-----------------

Turn left, and watch yourself for the Zombie that is waiting for you. 
You can actually get around him without firing a single shot if you wait 
for him to hobble to where the halls intersect. Do whatever, and enter 
the door at the end of the hall.

ATTIC DINING ROOM
---------------------

Collect the HANDGUN MAGAZINE setting on the edge of the table, then trot 
around it, and use your Lighter to set ablaze the candlestick on the 
table corner. If you dodged your friend in the hall, he should come 
barreling in, so fill him full of lead then check the cabinet in the 
left corner for some SHOTGUN SHELLS. Over on the other wall, you should 
notice that suspicious green cabinet -- push it to the right, and reveal 
a secret room. A ZOMBIE is waiting inside, so take it down. Check the 
bookcase and rechieve the MUSICAL SCORE. Exit out. 

ATTIC HALLWAY
-----------------

Exit out the door you came in to where Richard is.

RICHARD HALLWAY
-------------------

Round the corner and exit out.

DILAPIDATED BROWN HALLWAY
-----------------------------

Head right, and round the corner, entering the metal double doors.

KNIGHT ARMORY
-----------------

Immediately when you enter, four Knight statues move forward. Puzzle!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              KNIGHT PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, I was reading CVXFREAK's guide, and I have to say his solution is 
whacked up. You can solve this puzzle in just three moves. THREE of'em.


1# -- Move the FAR RIGHT statue back into place. 

2# -- Move the CLOSE LEFT statue back into place.

3# -- Move the CLOSE RIGHT statue back into place.


And the final statue automatically moves into place. This puzzle is made 
even easier with the fact the four knights each are holding a different 
weapon, and if you look at the back wall you see four portraits with the 
different knights. :p 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check the pedestal in the center of the knights, then flick the switch, 
which opens up a depression in the back wall. Go check it, and rechieve 
the JEWELRY BOX. 

Examine the Jewelry Box on your status screen, and if you check the lid 
it mentions a hint about "sunlight." The sun icon clearly has two shapes 
in it, a small tear-drop shape and large one. Press the switch on the 
front side, and on the back side (which have the same shapes). The 
center of the sun icon with light up, allowing the box to open and 
giving you a third DEATH MASK. Examine the mask -- it's MASK W/OUT ALL. 
Exit out this room. 

DILAPIDATED BROWN HALLWAY
-----------------------------

Go left and around the corner, then take the first door.

EAST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

Run forward and head down the stairs.

BOTTOM OF EAST STAIRS
-------------------------

Sitting on the wall by the stairs is a brown note:

"I left you some bullets in the room on your right. Feel free to use'em 
if you manage to get yourself in trouble.   -Barry-"

Enter the save room...   

EAST STAIRS STORAGE ROOM
----------------------------

Ah sweet ammo! Take all the clips, grenade (incendiary!) shells, and 
First Aid Sprays and put them away in the Item Box. Dump all the 
superficial crap, basically you just need Handgun, Handgun ammo, 
Shotgun, and Grenade Launcher. Keep the other four spots open in the 
inventory. SAVE your game, then get outta here.

BOTTOM OF EAST STAIRS
-------------------------

Trot up the stairs, again...

EAST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

Turn left and take the first door you see.

DEER HEAD GALLERY
---------------------

Errrr...no comment. Grab the RED HERB and GREEN HERB in the corner and 
combine them to get some MIXED HERBS. Full health heal, yah baby! Take 
the right door.

SPECIMEN LAB
---------------- 

Here we catch Barry checking out a Researcher's Will (file). Suspicious 
how the best part is missing and Barry scurries off in a hurry... ;)

• Check the hook box on the wall by the fish tank, and get the FISHHOOK.

• Head to the insect box by the bookcase, and get the LURE OF A BEE.

• Head to the lure box by the door, and pick up the BEE SPECIMEN.

Now, combine the Fishhook and Lure of a bee on the status screen. Seems 
the lure and specimen were reversed in the boxes...hint, hint...put the 
lure in the lure box, and the insect in the insect box. Press the 
switch, and you uncover a hidden alcove! After the bee comes alive, 
shoot it a few times with your Handgun to get rid of it.

NOTE: If you walk exactly right, you can squish the bee's body on the
      floor. Sweet sweet revenge...and it makes a beautiful "squish"
      sound and a large green puddle.

Grab the WIND CREST then leave this creepy room...

DEER HEAD GALLERY
---------------------

Take the door on the opposite side.

UPSTAIRS BEDROOM
--------------------

Take no heed of the camera view, there's NO monster under the desk. Grab 
the FIRST AID BOX sitting on the chair, and examine it's lid to get 
FIRST AID SPRAY. Check the desk in the corner for some INK RIBBON, then 
leave the room.

NOTE: Around the bed is some outta-sight Green Herb. 

DEER HEAD GALLERY
---------------------

Take the center door to the hall...

EAST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

Before moving on, go downstairs and dump any unneeded items, and make 
sure to have your Musical Score, Grenade Launcher loaded with Acid 
Shells, Shotgun, Handgun, Handgun ammo, and three empty inventory 
spaces. Come back upstairs and head right, round the corner, and exit 
out the door on the end. 

DILAPIDATED BROWN HALLWAY
-----------------------------

Travel to the end and use the last door.

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Travel down stairs, taking the double doors on the left.

DINING ROOM
---------------

Run along the table, then examine the fireplace at the end. Take the 
EMBLEM from the wall. Use the door to your side...

KENNETH HALLWAY
-------------------

The first door on your left •may• be shaking if a Zombie is pounding at 
it. Head right, and go down the hall. Take the second door on the right.

BAR AND LOUNGE
------------------

Examine the bar counter and pick up some lovely INK RIBBON, then take 
the little passage at the side of the piano. Push the bookcase to the 
right, revealing a shelf where you can pick up another MUSICAL SCORE. 
Combine the two scores on your status screen to get the complete 
MOONLIGHT SONATA. Trot Jill over to the piano and use the sonata; she 
then plays it (how moving, hold me...), revealing a hidden passage.

Travel inside the passage grabbing the GOLD EMBLEM on the wall 
piece...the door retracts behind you. Gee, I wonder what we do next? 
Place the Emblem in the Gold Emblem's place to open it up again. Grab 
Trevor's Diary at your feet before leaving...

KENNETH HALLWAY
-------------------

Head down and exit to the Dining Room again.

DINING ROOM
---------------

Place the Gold Emblem in the blank spot over the fireplace...nearby, the 
door on the clock opens revealing it's gears. Head over, and inspect the 
clock. I think it's puzzle time! Cha-ching.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              CLOCK PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This puzzle is extremely easy if you observe a few clues. But first, 
remember that:

• small gear moves the LONG hand
• large gear moves the SHORT hand
• both hands are pointing straight up, AKA, it's midnight

As you inspect the clock, you read the inscription -- "When the two have 
run each other through, the path to your destiny will open." 

Now, if you check the painting by the clock, it says -- "A picture of 
two knights striking each other. The short sword has been thrust into 
the breast of one knight, while the long sword has pierced the head of 
the other."

This should make the puzzle just TOO EASY. Just turn the short hand 
(large gear) twice to the RIGHT. Bing, bang, bong, we have the long hand 
pointing at the HELMET, and the short hand pointing at the ARMOR.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grab the MANSION KEY from the alcove that is revealed, and inspect it -- 
the SHIELD KEY. This key is actually pretty useless, as it opens up only 
one door. I sure hope you're well armed; with a Handgun, Shotgun, and 
Grenade Launcher...exit out the double doors.

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Head up the stairs, then take the first door on the RIGHT, which leads 
to the crappy (pun) looking brown hallway.

DILAPIDATED BROWN HALLWAY
-----------------------------

Take the door on the right...

RICHARD HALLWAY
-------------------

Round the corner (Richard is still asleep; unless you killed him like a 
horrible person by not bringing him Serum fast enough) then exit out the 
door.

ATTIC HALLWAY
-----------------

Run forward and trot up the stairs. BEFORE entering, have your Shotgun 
equipped. Open the cobweb-infested door with your Shield Key, then 
discard it...

ATTIC
---------

Hmmm...quiet, too quiet. Head down the room -- out of no where a GIANT 
Python pops out of the rafter. I swear, that scared the LIVING CRAP out 
of me the first time! :p Time, for a boss fight.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         BOSS -- Yawn the Python
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This guy is such a pain. He'll sling around and try to trap you in a 
little space with his body, and then when he rears up, prepare for a 
bite -- which not only damages you, but POISONS as well. Where's that 
Blue Herb when we need it? Blast him a few times with your Shotgun, and 
maybe a few Acid Shells if you run out of Shotgun ammo. A little ways 
into the battle, Richard comes in to get his revenge and starts firing 
at the snake with a Shotgun. Eventually Yawn eats Richard like a 
bastard, but you should quickly finish off the snake causing it to run 
away...

NOTE: If you didn't save Richard earlier using the Serum, you're going
      to have to scare off Yawn all by yourself!

SECOND NOTE: •Technically•, you don't have to fight Yawn, you can just
             take the Death Mask and Assault Rifle and leave. But it's
             definitely not as much fun...
             
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY:

(from Dart533@cs.com)


"I tried a different way of attacking Yawn. I used the survival knife.
Yes, the knife. What I did was I set up Yawn so he was coiling up, but I
was on the outside. I would slash him, run a couple steps, slash him, 
run a couple steps, slash him, etc. This actually worked amazingly well. 
He tried to bite me a couple times, but as long as you stay near the 
middle of his body, it'll work really really nice. Just make sure you 
are on the OUTSIDE of him, and only slash one time before running again.
It takes time, but it saves lots and lots of ammo.   

Oh, by the way, you should put in that you won't get hit at ALL. (at 
least I didn't) And it also works for both fights."   


Thank you, Dart533.
I'm sure this would work EXCELLENTLY for Hard mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where Richard was eaten, head over a grab the sparkle, an ASSAULT 
SHOTGUN. This weapon is great, not only does it hold 10 shells, instead 
of a regular Shotgun's six, but just look at it -- the things GREAT 
looking. Head to the upper left hand corner of the room and grab the 
fourth and final DEATH MASK sitting on the wooden crate. This one's MASK 
W/OUT NOSE. Since we have all four Death Masks, we can use them in the 
Graveyard. You remember those four statues in the Crypt, right? Exit out 
of here...

ATTIC HALLWAY
-----------------

Run straight ahead and use the door.

NOTE: If you were bitten by the snake and POISONED, Jill will say she
      needs some Serum and you need to get to the downstairs Drug Room.
      On my last game, Barry carried Jill to the Drug Room bed...I don't
      know what triggers that, but maybe it happens if you were REALLY
      badly damaged.

RICHARD (BYE-BYE) HALLWAY
-----------------------------

A Zombie will be waiting for you, so get around him then exit the other 
door. You should head to the Drug Room save area so you can get ALL four 
of the Death Masks, along with a Handgun, Handgun ammo, Shotgun, and 
your Grenade Launcher filled with INCENDIARY SHELLS. Serum too, if 
you're poisoned. Also save your game...head to the foyer when you're 
through.

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Head up the first set of stairs and use the door to the Graveyard.

GRAVEYARD
-------------

Run down both sets of stairs, then travel forward and descend the stairs 
to the Crypt.

CRYPT
---------

See the four statues lining the wall? Place the four Death Masks on each 
appropriate statue -- everytime a mask is place, the nearby suspended 
coffin is disturbed...and what the nut is that blood from?! After all 
four masks are placed, the coffin falls and flies open...head over to 
inspect it. A gate shuts blocking the entrance and out pops an ol' 
Crimson Head.

Ah crap.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        BOSS -- Mega Crimson Head
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're prepared, this guy is a chinch. Equip your GRENADE LAUNCHER 
filled with INCENDIARY Shells, then fire a few at him. Each shell should 
knock him to the floor. Unless your pathetic, you shouldn't get damaged, 
AT ALL, and you probably wouldn't even need to move! The incendiary 
shells should leave his corpse extra crispy...I just need some barbecue 
sauce now...delicious...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grab the item beside the coffin -- some SHOTGUN SHELLS -- then check the 
coffin. Jill will flip a switch opening the entrance along with finding 
a STONE & METAL OBJECT. Basically, an octagonal-edged disk with the 
Umbrella insignia. Leave the Crypt, backtracking up the stairs.

GRAVEYARD
-------------

Run along the path, but at the end take the side gate.

PORTRAIT GALLERY
--------------------

Travel down the hall and exit out the door at the end.

EAST HALLWAY
----------------

Clever shortcut, no? Run forward but watch that friggen Zombie. Get 
around him and exit out the door at the end...

VINE PASSAGE
----------------

Arm yourself with a Shotgun, then tread lightly down the path. Blow to 
bits that Kojo Jr. that pops over the wall and continue on -- at the 
end, examine that "shelf" depression. "To the defiler of the accursed 
coffin." Place in the Stone & Metal Object, which unlocks the adjacent 
door...head through.

GARDEN SUPPLY SHED
----------------------

There's a FIRST AID SPRAY and BATTERY PACK on the shelf over the stairs, 
and some SHOTGUN SHELLS in the shed corner. There's two ways to get to 
the Courtyard (area two), but we want to exit out the door at the bottom 
of the stairs...

SPECIALTY ITEMS TO COLLECT:
-------------------------------

1. Courtyard Map
2. Square Crank
3. Moon Crest
4. Star Crest

6. Magnum Revolver



DESOLATE SIDE PATH 
----------------------

It may be a bit uneasy to step out side, but there's no enemies in this 
section. Trot down the steps then turn right, following the path till 
you come to a nearby signpost...we've got another puzzle here. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             CERBERUS PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sign reads: 

North: Valley of Destruction
South: Cave of Hatred
East:  Summit of Madness
West:  Path of Revenge

Keep those locations in mind. Follow the winding path all the way to the 
end, where you come to two Cerberus statues and a locked gate. The gate 
reads -- "The gates will open when the guard dog's desires are 
fulfilled." Now check both statues...

LEFT STATUE   -- "The Last Gasps of Destruction" 
RIGHT STATUE  -- "The War Cry of Revenge"

Back a ways you should have passed two weathervanes -- the blue one goes 
to the left statue, and the red to the right. Turn the blue one to the 
NORTH, and the red one to the WEST. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ta-dah, the gate unlocks! Pass on through... 

FOREST GRAVEYARD
--------------------

Absolutely nothing to do here yet, unless you like watching some Crows. 
Follow the path straight and take the opposite gate.

PATH THROUGH THE WOODS
--------------------------

What was that strange noise? Cough. ;) Another no-brainer here -- follow 
the trail to the end, where you find a Cabin at the top of the hill. 
Enter the front door.

CABIN
---------

Head around the corner, then another one. Everything is covered in 
cobwebs and there's a bunch of junk laying around, but strangely, the 
fireplace is lit...hmmm. Trot up the staircase then grab the COURTYARD 
MAP on the wall. Enter the next room, where we have a bed, but more 
importantly a TYPEWRITER. Examine the area of the table where the lamp 
is -- we get a STRANGE file that's in barely decipherable English. 

Head to the next area, which is a hallway with an ITEM BOX. Take out 
some Ink Ribbon if you need to and go save your game, then come back 
here. Trot to the right, hop down to the lower area, and grab the CRANK 
sitting on the board at the end. Examine the tip of it; it's renamed 
SQUARE CRANK. 

Climb back up and deposit any junk in the Item Box. You just need a 
Handgun, Handgun ammo, Shotgun, Square Crank, and your Wind Crest. Head 
back to the bedroom -- THE FRONT DOOR opens -- check the window beside 
you to see some-body/thing slink out of view...trot out the doorway. 
THUNK! Jill is knocked unconscious by a pair of arms, but she awakens in 
time to have an encounter with Lisa (the monster in chains)!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          BOSS -- Lisa Trevor 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now we know what that sound was at the beginning of the Path Through the 
Woods! DO NOT fight this thing (as it's invincible) just get out the 
HELL of here. You may want to fire a few times to stun her, since Lisa 
will swipe you if you get close, which takes off a hefty amount of 
damage. Leave the Cabin when you get to the door.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

PATH THROUGH THE WOODS
--------------------------

Backtrack all the way to the bottom of the hill, though you will 
encounter a (as in ONE) Zombie along the way...hardly exciting.

FOREST GRAVEYARD
-------------------- 

The Crows make this part so friggen ANNOYING. Run forward and up the 
trail between the gravestones, causing the Crows (99% of the time) to be 
disturbed and start chasing you. Puzz-ah time! 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             CREST PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examine the right tombstone to uncover a suspicious indentation...place 
your Wind Crest in it, which causes a panel to flip over revealing three 
more crests. 

• Check the tombstone three more times, picking up the MOON CREST, STAR
  CREST, and SUN CREST. 

• Examine the back of each crest on your status screen and press the
  buttons you find, causing styles of iron bars to pop out.  

• Place the crests in the opposite tombstone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your prized is revealed -- a coveted MAGNUM REVOLVER. An EXTREMELY 
powerful gun, but slow firing (and the ammo is scarce), so use it ONLY 
on bosses. Now take the other gate out of here before you get mauled to 
death by the Crows. Woo boy. 

DESOLATE SIDE PATH
----------------------

Backtrack to the beginning and use the door. Once in the Garden Supply 
Shed, take the wooden double doors.

PILLAR COURTYARD
--------------------

Run forward a few steps and Brad will contact you on your radio. After a 
totally pointless cutscene, you can here a strange "pacing" sound ahead. 
This is coming from a GROUP of Cerberus in the next little area...there 
are two ways to tackle this problem.

Man's Way -- Arm yourself with a Shotgun (Assault, preferably) and
             bust on in there, firing off shots at POINT-BLANK range
             at the dogs. Use the pillars to shield you, too. 

Coward's Way -- HUG the right wall as you run, to keep from being
                mauled...

I prefer the first way, as not only do you free yourself from danger, 
but you also get access to a some herb. Plus, it boosts your ego. :p 
Either way, exit out the gate at the top of the stairs.

STORAGE POOL
----------------

I have no idea why they would have this pond, maybe for the Mansion's 
plumbing system, but I sure wouldn't be drinking that water. Run around 
the left side of the pool, where at the end you find a pillar with a 
square-shaped hole (ahem). Use your Square Crank on it, causing some 
gates below to open and drain the pool. Cha-ching! Head back around and 
use the ladder, running along the brick path at the bottom and taking 
the other ladder. Follow this path to end where an old-style Lift is 
waiting for you...

WATERFALL COURTYARD
----------------------- 
  
More Crows, arg. Run forward, going around the waterfall and use the 
other gate (nothing to see here yet). 

BRICK CORRIDOR
------------------

Follow the Corridor all the way to the end and use the door. RUN the 
whole time, to avoid Snakes that drop from above.

FRONT HALLWAY
-----------------

Oh, so •that's• why they call it RESIDENT Evil. Hohoho. Ahead is some 
BLUE HERB on shelves, so come back here if you get poisoned. Round the 
corner and take the first door on the right.

RESIDENTIAL STORAGE
-----------------------

Another save room, if you will. You can find a TYPEWRITER on the table 
and a KEROSENE TANK and ITEM BOX past the fence. Grab the FIRST AID 
SPRAY at your feet, and the BATTERY PACK and INK RIBBON on the shelf. 
SAVE your game, and deposit •all• your stuff in the Item Box and take 
out your Lighter. Exit out of the room...

FRONT HALLWAY
-----------------

Turn right, and use the double doors at the end.

RECREATION ROOM
------------------- 

Ahhhhh, Giant Spider on the roof (avoid these things entirely). Quickly, 
run left, then in the back corner you should spot a RED candle on a 
table. Go over and light it, casting a strange silhouette:

                                 _\|/_
                                <_(_)_>
                                   |  

Yes, crappy ascii, but bare with me (besides there's two more muwahah). 
Head back to the door, watching the Giant Spider, and go round the 
corner. Run down the first set of stairs. At the bottom, grab the 
SHOTGUN SHELLS on the first table, then the RED BOOK and FIRST AID BOX 
on the bar. Examine the box to get MIXED HERBS -- one green, one blue. 
Now light another strange candle (this one's GREEN) on the other table. 
We get a silhouette like so:
                                 _\_/_
                                <_(_)_>
                                     
Different then the previous one, yes? Head back up the stairs, then take 
the next set of stairs. There's another Giant Spider, but he wouldn't 
bug'ya. Light the final (ORANGE) candle in the corner:
                                 _____
                               -<_(_)_>-
                                     
Now check the pool table at the center...we have some balls (snicker) 
with varying colors and numbers:

2 -- Blue   4 -- Purple   6 -- Green
3 -- Red    5 -- Orange
 
All those previous clues add up to a solution to a very tricky puzzle 
coming up shortly. Exit completely out of this room. 

FRONT HALLWAY
----------------- 

Head back to the storage room...

RESIDENTIAL STORAGE
-----------------------

Deposit all the stuff you just got in the Item Box, and get out a 
Handgun and Handgun ammo. Exit out.

FRONT HALLWAY
-----------------

Head to the right, where you'll spot a crate in the hall, and a nearby 
corridor with littered with holes in the floor. If you just run over the
holes, expect to be strangled for a few seconds by a giant vine that 
pops up. It's only slightly damaging, but VERY annoying. To get around 
this, take the crate and push it like the diagram shows below. I added 
the diagram because the other guides are poorly written on this fact! 
  
   (BEFORE)               (AFTER)

|    |                |    |                     
| [1]|________ D      |    |________ D
|        [][]  o      |     [2][][]  o
|     ________ o      |     ________ o
|    |         r      |    |         r
|    |                |    |

Like so...now all you need to do is climb over the tops of the boxes and 
use the door at the end! 

INNER HALLWAY
-----------------

Run down the hallway and go around the corner, taking the second door 
with the "002" on top of it. Before going in, Jill listens to a 
INTERESTING conversation with Barry and some shadow-type character. 
Apparently, they wish to get rid of S.T.A.R.S...afterwards Jill accesses 
the room and Barry scurries off. 

ROOM 002
------------

Take the door on your right side. It's actually quite hard to see, and 
in my first game I couldn't find it for awhile! Doh. 

002 BATHROOM
----------------

Toilet's busted...lovely, trotting over a fecal covered floor. Not 
what I had in mind. Grab the shiny object on the shelf by the toilet; 
it's a RESIDENCE KEY, and if you examine it on the status screen it's 
renamed -- KEY FOR ROOM 001. Yes, that's the door rattling, and after 
the Zombie pops it kill the dang thing then leave.

ROOM 002
------------
 
Run forward and check the desk at your left for a "Plant 42 Report."
Read that, it has very useful information. Head to the two identical
bookcases at the end of the room...push the left one back against the
wall, then push the right bookcase to the right. You uncover a ladder,
but don't go down it yet, instead exit this room going back to the 
hallway. 

INNER HALLWAY
-----------------

Round the corner and backtrack down the hallway to the door at the end.

FRONT HALLWAY
-----------------

Climb over the tops of the crates, then take the door off to your left,
unlocking it with the Key for Room 001. Discard the key and enter. 

ROOM 001
------------

Some guy's foot is at the corner of the screen, he's hanging from the 
rafters, so no, he wouldn't attack. Run down the hall piece and in the 
next bedroom area grab the HANDGUN MAGAZINE on the desk. Beside that, 
grab the SELF DEFENSE GUN -- you also get a "Suicide Note." The gun 
fires a single bullet that should stop a Zombie dead in its tracks. Grab 
the other HANDGUN MAGAZINE on the rocking chair then exit through the 
side door...

001 BATHROOM
----------------

Drain the bathtub and grab the CONTROL ROOM KEY you find in the bottom. 
SNAP -- outside a rope breaks and should be PRETTY obvious where it came 
from. The dead guy by the bathtub also comes alive, so get out of here, 
NOW, don't bother wasting ammo.

ROOM 001
------------

Exit back into the hallway.

FRONT HALLWAY
-----------------

Run ahead and climb over the crate tops, then use the door again.

INNER HALLWAY
-----------------

Follow it to the end, then enter Room 002.

ROOM 002
------------ 

Use the ladder in the back by the bookcases.

AQUA RING -- ACCESS TUNNEL A664-1
-------------------------------------

Follow this tunnel to the end, where you find three wooden crates and a 
pool of water you can't pass.

• Push the crate closest to the water straight ahead, into the pool.
• Push the second closest crate into the pool.
• Push the farthest crate around the corner, then into the pool.

Run across the bridge created, and DEFINITELY, grab that GREEN HERB in 
the corner. Wade through the water and open the metal double doors.

AQUA RING -- SHARK ENCLOSURE
--------------------------------

If you stick around here you'll be shark-food for sure! 

NOTE: Due to the waist-high water, your running is slowed considerably. 

Run along the catwalk to your left, and you'll see a cutscene of 
incoming sharks. MOVE YOUR JILL VALENTINE ASS! Keep following the 
catwalk till you come across a small bridge. Cross it, then head left 
along the inner catwalk. Trot up the stairs when you reach them, and 
unlock the door with the Control Room Key. Discard the key and enter 
inside QUICKLY. 

SECOND NOTE: Those sharks that swim around and bite at you are only the
             BABIES. Yes, only BABIES. If you hang around you might
             actually see the mother, Neptune -- she can swallow you in
             ONE BITE! Not to mention scare the crap out of you...

AQUA RING -- CONTROL ROOM
-----------------------------

You can use the herb you got in the Access Tunnel if you got bit by a 
shark (and you most likely did). The red lamp to your right indicates an 
emergency has occurred. Head down the ladder.

At the bottom here, check the spotted document on the table to your 
left. It'll say which valve to release in case of a drop in OIL 
PRESSURE. Keep this number in mind! Collect the AQUA RING MAP on the 
back wall, then head back to the ladder. Our goal now is to drain the 
water in the Shark Enclosure... 

• Head to the side window, and examine the console...say "yes" to
  draining the water. A malfunction occurs, and one of those bastard
  sharks headbutts the window, causing a critical loss of pressure in
  the room.

NOTE: When the critical gauge comes on, your difficulty (easy/normal)
      depends on how fast it fills up.

• Run to the console with the black chair in front of it. Examine, then
  release the safety.
 
• Run to the console in front of the main window. Choose to lower the
  Pressure Doors. Another malfunction -- the doors stop midway. We need
  to restore the oil pressure before continuing. 

• Head out to the hallway and check the tanks just to your right. Choose
  the correct valve (1,2,3...whatever was on the document) and turn it 
  back on.

• Head back into the room, examine the console with the chair, and
  release the safety a second time.

• Examine the console in front of the main windows, and lower the
  Pressure Doors. The emergency is OVER!

Now just lower the water in the Shark Enclosure using the console in 
front of the side window. Head into the hall, grabbing the FIRST AID BOX
by the tanks. Examine it to get MIXED HERBS, of two Green Herbs. Run 
down the hall, and use the door at the end.

AQUA RING -- STORAGE CHAMBER
--------------------------------

Everything is soaking wet. Turn right and go down the hall, then run 
right into that little cloister will stuff piled everywhere. Grab the 
GRENADE SHELLS here (they're quite hard to spot). Turn around and exit 
out the single door on the other side.

AQUA RING -- ENCLOSURE FLOOR
--------------------------------

Run along the tank bottom...eventually you come across the body of Shark 
laying on the floor. He's still alive, but a Handgun bullet to the skull 
outta do him in. :p Keep going to the end, and wade through the waist-
deep water. Don't worry about Neptune...she's "dead." ;) Climb up on the 
grating, then •attempt• to press the switch in the box. SPLASH! The box 
breaks and Neptune is actually alive...you can't go back in the water, 
what to do?!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       BOSS -- Neptune the Shark
------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two ways to do this...

(Stupid) Pump tons of rounds into her body, wasting precious ammo yet
         eventually killing her.

(Smart)  Push that green box (an electrical generator) into the water,
         then flip the lever on the control panel beside you. The water
         will electrify and shock Neptune to death.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

...glad you made the right decision. Hop down into the water again and 
wade around her charcoaled body, picking up the sparkle. Another 
RESIDENCE KEY. Examine it, this one's the GALLERY KEY. Wade out of the 
water then backtrack to the door at the beginning of the tank and exit.

AQUA RING -- STORAGE CHAMBER
--------------------------------

Turn right, and head down the hall, exiting out the double doors.

AQUA RING -- EXIT TUNNEL
----------------------------

Run forward and grab the MAGNUM ROUNDS on the box, then climb up the 
ladder at the end of the tunnel. At the top use the door...

AQUA RING -- ACCESS TUNNEL A644-1
-------------------------------------

Run left, and backtrack to the end, using the ladder to climb back out.

ROOM 002
------------

Use the main door and exit into the hall.

INNER HALLWAY
-----------------

Trot around the corner and use the Gallery Key to unlock the adjacent 
door. Discard the key. Before heading in the Gallery, you should go back 
to the Residential Storage (save room) and put EVERYTHING in the Item 
Box, and take out your RED BOOK. 

GALLERY
-----------

God, this place is SWARMING with Killer Bees (they can also poison you 
if you're stung enough), so don't try to do ANYTHING in here yet, just 
stay moving! Run forward, then turn left at the table and run down the 
hall. Examine the body laying dead in the corner, uncovering something 
he's holding, INSECTICIDE SPRAY. Gee, wonder what we should do with 
this? 

NOTE: Off to your left is the Killer Bee Hive (it's HUGE!) but you can't
      access it because the swarming is so veracious. 

Turn 180 quickly so you're not stung, and run back down the hall. Turn 
at the table then exit back out the door at the end.

INNER HALLWAY
-----------------

Turn right and pass the door to Room 002, then at the dead end grab the 
RESIDENTIAL MAP. There's a hole behind it, DON'T INSPECT IT (as bees 
will pop out). Just use your Insecticide Spray and Jill will send a 
cloud through, killing the hive in the adjacent hallway. Turn yourself 
around and enter the Gallery again.

GALLERY
-----------

Run forward and grab the HANDGUN MAGAZINE on the table...turn left again 
and go down the hall, then turn left a second time. Grab the sparkle at 
the end, the final RESIDENTIAL KEY. Examine the back of it, where it's 
renamed KEY FOR ROOM 003. Backtrack out of the hallway, and use the key 
to unlock the door on the right. Discard and head in.

ROOM 003
-----------

Nab the INK RIBBON on the little shelf ahead of you. Take the side door.

003 BATHROOM
----------------

Weird plant roots are sticking out of the wall! Drain the water in the 
bathtub, and grab the DAGGER that's uncovered. Exit out...

ROOM 003
------------

You can SAVE YOUR GAME with the TYPEWRITER on the table. Examine the 
bookcase beside the table, and you'll find a row of red books, yet 
suspiciously the center book is white colored. Remove the white book and 
you get an "Organic Chemistry Lab Experiment" file. Now, place the Red 
Book in the gap. Ding ding, puzzle time!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             RED BOOK PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our task is to arrange the "Bandage with Blood" books in the correct 
order so that the naked woman on the book spines is arranged properly. 
Don't know why, she's ugly to begin with, but anyway...

                             _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
                            | | | | | | | | |
                            |1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
                            |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|

                         Exchange books 1 and 4.
                         Exchange books 2 and 7.
                         Exchange books 3 and 8.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Afterwards the nearby bookcase moves, revealing a SECRET DOOR! Once you 
go through there, you're going to be in the Lair of Plant 42, something 
we don't want to do, yet...unless you feel like fighting the Plant 42 
with conventional weaponry, then you can just skip ahead to the Boss 
Strategy. 

If you read on here, we're going to make J-VOLT, a chemical to kill the 
plant without using ANY AMMO (should know that if you read the Organic 
Lab file). Exit Room 003, back into the Gallery.

GALLERY
-----------

Head over to that door by the lab table. Examine it, and you'll discover 
it's locked by a rather sophisticated keypad device. If you remember the 
clues earlier from the Recreation Room (the candle silhouettes, the pool 
balls) this code is pretty easy, but here's the solution anyway:


RED -- 3   ORANGE -- 5   GREEN -- 6


NOTE: On HARD MODE, the game actually gets RID of the colors, making you
      remember where each number goes just by the silhouette shapes!


------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         J-VOLT CREATION PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Now that we're here in the Chemical Lab, time to make some J-VOLT! But 
first, look at the diagram so you know what's around you:


             CHEMICAL LAB DIAGRAM                        ------------

 '-------------------------------------------'


OK, now let's begin -- follow these instructions EXACTLY, as making a 
mixture in the incorrect proportions results in a TOXIC gas, i.e. it 
hurts you.   

STEP #1 -- Grab three of the EMPTY BOTTLE, they're the small shiny
           things on the counters. You only need three, not four.

STEP #2 -- Now that we have something to mix in, you should check the
           "Values" and "Equations" on the two walls shown above.

      EQUATIONS                     VALUES
.-------------------.        .-------------------.
|    1 + 3  = 4     |        |    Water  = 1     |
|    4 + 6  = 10    |        |    Red    = 3     |
|    1 + 6  = 7     |        |    Purple = 4     |
|    10 + 7 = 17    |        |    Yellow = 6     |
|    17 + 3 = 20    |        '-------------------'
'-------------------'

No, these aren't here to make sure you've graduated second grade math 
(though you sure would be in trouble if you failed), they show how the 
chemicals should be mixed together to reach J-VOLT, with a value of 20. 


STEP #3 -- Fill one your bottles with Water. Then fill another bottle
           with UMB No.3. Now, combine those two together in one
           bottle to get NP-004. 

STEP #4 -- Collect some Yellow-6 in an Empty Bottle, then combine that
           with the NP-004. You'll get the chemical UMB No.10.

STEP #5 -- Collect some more Water in an Empty Bottle, and then some
           more Yellow-6. Combine those two together to get UMB No.7.

STEP #6 -- Combine UMB No.10 and UMB No.7 in the same bottle. You'll get
           the chemical VP-017.

FINAL STEP -- Collect some UMB No.3 in an Empty Bottle, and combine it
              with the VP-017. You get the J-VOLT! Cha-ching! 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since we've got the J-VOLT, now we have to apply it to Plant 42's roots. 
Where are they you ask? Follow this steps:

A)  Exit the Chemical Lab.
B)  Exit the Gallery, going back to the Inner Hallway.
C)  From the Inner Hallway, enter Room 002 
D)  Use the ladder at the bookcases.
E)  In the Access Tunnel, follow it till you reach the door, then enter.
F)  In the Exit Tunnel, climb down the ladder and exit out the door.
G)  In the Storage Chamber, use the single door right beside you.
H)  Climb the ladder, and exit out of the Control Room.
I)  We're back at the Shark Enclosure, so use the door adjacent to you.

GUARD ROOM
--------------

This room is partly flooded and the roots are undulating out of the 
ceiling! Run over to them, and use your J-VOLT...they'll shrivel away 
and now all you must do is head back to the Gallery.

GALLERY
-----------

Head around the table, and use the door to Room 003.

ROOM 003
------------

Use the door you uncovered earlier...prepare yourself! :p 

LAIR OF PLANT 42
--------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            BOSS -- Plant 42
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Depending on what you did earlier, there's two ways to fight this Botany 
Biohazard (crap, that was catchy...).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
GUNS BLAZIN'

The key here is that once you get in the room, IMMEDIATELY barrel up the 
stairs in front of you, then at the top STAY MOVING while you fire shots 
at the plant's "flower." Mind you the flower has to be OPEN. Keep doing 
that till it dies.

Now most guides will say something along the lines of "equip a Grenade 
Launcher loaded with...blah blah." IGNORE THAT! The Shotgun is FAR 
superior against the Plant 42 -- let me explain. See, when you try to 
shoot grenades at the flower, the trajectory of the grenade tends to 
fall and narrowly miss. This can lead to misspent ammo...not so with the 
Shotgun! Every shot will lock on target (unless you have REALLY bad aim, 
I'm talkin' actually aiming in the WRONG direction). Besides, who really 
wants to waste precious ammo? However, if you REALLY feel like using 
some grenades, try to alternate between Incendiary Shells and Shotgun 
Shells... 

NOTE: Sometimes when you're on the top balcony, and a vine hits you,
      it'll knock you clear off and onto the GROUND FLOOR. 

SECOND NOTE: When the main "flower" opens, Plant 42 also gets more
             aggressive -- some vines will try to spray you with
             damaging pollen. 

THIRD NOTE: Also watch those little "buds" found on some of the walls,
            they can spray pollen too!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
J-VOLTIN' 

If you used the J-VOLT on the roots earlier, a cutscene plays showing 
the plant dying -- but not before it scoops Jill up with one of it's 
vines. Barry trots in with a Flamethrower, gets scooped up too, but 
quickly barbecues the entire plant. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the threat over, run to the fireplace and grab the sparkle, another 
MANSION KEY. Examine the back of it; the HELMET KEY. Yes, we merely 
trekked all the way over here for the SOLE PURPOSE of just getting 
another key. This fact in particular pissed me off. You can exit the 
room now, except you have to take the double doors, because some 
mysterious fool removed one of the Red Books in the adjacent room 
causing the single door to relock. 

GALLERY
-----------

Exit out the main door, going into the Inner Hallway...

INNER HALLWAY
-----------------

Head right, where a cutscene will play; Jill finds Wesker shooting some 
Giant Bees with his Handgun (why?!). Apparently there are some rooms in 
the mansion we still have to explore (duh duh). Exit out the door at the 
end of the hallway...squish the bees on your way out! :p

FRONT HALLWAY
-----------------

You can just run directly over the holes, as Plant 42 wouldn't grab you 
anymore. Round the corner to the right, then round another corner. You 
may want to grab a BLUE HERB from the shelves (just one) in case you get 
poisoned in a bit (as the mansion has no readily available Blue Herb, 
and trust me, you don't want to waste coming all the way out here 
again). Exit out the front door.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            C O U R T Y A R D
------------------------------------------------------------------------



BRICK CORRIDOR
------------------

Follow this all the way to the end and use the gate...

WATERFALL COURTYARD
-----------------------

Well, well, well. Seems some Cerberus have come to greet you. The dog 
right in front of you wouldn't get up until you run right beside him -- 
head for the lift! If you're fast (aka good) you'll make it without 
taking any damage.

STORAGE POOL
----------------

After you step off the lift, run down the path. We have a little snake 
problem to take care of...


L_______________________               I swear, nearly •every• time that
I                       |              snake gets me. NEVER AGAIN! This

T                 |     |_________     problem...yes I'm probably insane
                  |    2          |    for making it. :p

                            |_____|


See, once you round the corner with the lamp, a "hidden" snake will pop 
out at POINT 1, and attempt to bite you. To avoid this, round the corner 
as tight as possible against the wall at POINT 2. There...the "horror" 
is over. Head down the ladder, run along the path at the bottom, and use 
the other ladder. Exit out the gate.

PILLAR COURTYARD
--------------------

Exit out the wooden double doors in the alcove.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             M A N S I O N

GARDEN SUPPLY SHED
----------------------

Barry's been here! If you head to the door opposite of you, you'll find 
another brown note on the wall:

"Use this thing to protect yourself from that bullet-proof thing in 
chains. I went ahead and fixed that piece of crap door, too.   -Barry-"

That door with the faulty doorknob in the east of the mansion is now 
fixed. Grab the stuff Barry left for you, then take the door beside you.

VINE PASSAGE
----------------

Head down the passage and use the door at the end, entering the mansion 
building proper again. 

EAST HALLWAY
----------------

Run own the hall piece and round the corner...THE HORROR! ;) A cutscene 
plays showing something following you. Now, those growls and screams are 
coming from a "Hunter," Which basically looks like a guy in a frog suit, 
not nearly as scary as Crimson Head. However Hunters are more dangerous, 
as sometimes they'll do a "Leap Attack" where they claw your head 
killing you instantly. Now some people say it decapitates you, but I've 
never actually seen the removed head. You can either take this Hunter 
out or do the smart thing and exit out the side door by the chair.

BOTTOM OF EAST STAIRS
-------------------------

Run down the hall, and watch yourself, another Hunter is waiting here 
for you. Take the side door entering the save room.

EAST STAIRS STORAGE ROOM
----------------------------

Deposit all extraneous stuff and SAVE YOUR GAME. You just need a 
Handgun, Handgun ammo, a Grenade Launcher filled with Acid Shells, and 
your Helmet Key. Exit out.

BOTTOM OF EAST STAIRS
-------------------------

Barrel up the stairs as soon as possible to avoid the Hunter, or use 
your Shotgun to turn him bloodier than Jason's acting career. Either 
way, get to the top of the stairs.

EAST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

Head left, and run down the hall, rounding the corner. Use the end door.

FIREPLACE STUDY
-------------------

Herbs off to your side...open the other door using your Helmet Key and 
exit out.

ART GALLERY
---------------

Could also be called "Room of the Crushing Walls of a Horrible Squishy 
Death by Proxy." But I like my name better. :p We have another puzzle, 
and this one is pretty hard, as if you screw up you'll die and find out 
what a pancake feels like.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              STATUE PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run ahead, and immediately push the grey statue FORWARD, as it AWAY from 
the wall. Keep pushing it to the next chamber, where the two walls will 
begin to crush inwards. They CAN'T hurt you, you have the statue as 
protection. Push the statue ALL the way to the VERY end.

Turn yourself around and run down the narrow space. When in the next 
little area, take the other passage. We're actually behind the wall now! 
Run all the way to the end and examine the alcove on the wall. OK, 
here's where it gets hard.

• Hit the switch, causing the walls to start retracting.
• Flip yourself around, and backtrack to the other area.
• Take the other passage again, and run down to the statue.
• Push it LEFT, until it covers that square with the "N". 
• A secret passage is revealed! 

The camera angles seem to make this puzzle much harder then it should 
be...but ah well, you'll get it eventually, that is if you don't die a 
horrible death in the meantime. :p

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head through the passage and go to the left. Examine the dresser to get 
a BATTERY PACK. Turn around and go to the other side, where you find a 
hole. Say "yes" to pop on in.

GEORGE TREVOR'S CRAPPY GRAVE
--------------------------------

Who turned out the lights? Run forward and grab the LAST BOOK VOL.1 
laying on the ground. On your status screen examine the edge of the book 
where you can see the length of the pages. The book will open up, 
revealing a MEDAL OF EAGLE. Head forward some more, and check the 
gravestone to get a file -- "George Trevor's Diary." It's so long, and 
my eyes glaze over most of the time before I finish it. Say "yes" to 
hitting the switch, which reveals a hole and a ladder. Head down...

BASEMENT CORRIDOR
---------------------  

There are some Giant Spiders in this area, and they're acid spit will 
poison you. But, there's a Blue Herb in the next area, so you can pretty 
much ignore them. 

Head forward and round the corner, ignoring the first spider. Travel 
down, then go to the right. Grab the B1 MANSION MAP on the wall. Round 
another corner, and examine the •seemingly• useless stack of boxes...you 
get some SHOTGUN SHELLS. Turn around, go around the corner, and 
backtrack, this time taking the left way. Watch the second spider! Round 
a final corner and use the door at the end...

GENERATOR CORRIDOR
----------------------

This corridor has a layer of water at the bottom...interesting. Round 
the first corner and use the Blue Herb if you need it. Keep going till 
you reach the fork (two Zombies will greet you). Head through the gated 
passage. Go around the flooded corner and at the end examine the machine 
on the wall. Say "yes" to switching the fusepack, thus restoring power 
to the elevator. Backtrack around the corner and to the fork, this time 
taking the other way (watch the Zombies). Head to the end, but before 
exiting out the door, examine the shelf just to the right of the door. 
You get a HANDGUN MAGAZINE. Now you may exit...

KITCHEN
-----------

OK...let me get this straight, the floor of the previous corridor was 
flooded, but the Kitchen's floor isn't? Even though they're on the same 
level. And clearly the door between them isn't waterproof...arg. Anyway, 
on the opposite side of the table from you is a Zombie, which should be 
approaching at a snail's pace. Wait for it to come a few paces from you, 
then go around the other side of the table. At the back round the corner 
into a small side area (no, that guy wouldn't magically wake up all 
crimsony). Go to the elevator and say "yes" to bring it down. Press A 
when it reaches you.

Wait. Where's my elevator music?! *pops in Donkey Kong 64 soundtrack* 

ELEVATOR HALLWAY
--------------------

Head to the right, and round the corner.

NOTE: Off to your left is some herbs, but it's hardly worth it. The
      plants are in a dead end and there's a Zombie keeping watch.

A Zombie greets you...get past it, then open that first door here.

CLOSET
----------

At your feet to the left is some ACID SHELLS and MAGNUM ROUNDS. Yummy 
metallic goodness. Head forward and examine the floor by the desk for a 
BATTERY PACK, then check the desk itself for the BATTERY. This Battery 
will activate a lift in the Courtyard...exit the room.

ELEVATOR HALLWAY
--------------------
 
We've come out of the closet! *snicker* Turn to the left and run down 
the hall, unlocking the door. Exit out.

YELLOW CORRIDOR
-------------------

A Crimson Head and a normal Zombie are in here (unless you killed 
them...), except they're up ahead and will try to ambush you from two 
directions. Be CAREFUL, or you could be a Jill sandwich before you know 
it. ;) Head forward and turn to the right, running down the long hall. 

*breaths heavily* Whip left around the corner (CRIMSON!) then cross 
through that little gap with the mirror, then turn right, running down 
the hall and exiting out the door.

NOTE: You might just want to kill the Crimson with a grenade or two and
      be done with it.

KNIGHTS' HALLWAY
--------------------

Trot up the stairs and head to the end, where you open the door with 
your Helmet Key...head into the abyss.

LIBRARY
-----------

Herbs are in front of you, grab them if you have room. Run down the 
window hall and head around the corner where the first bookcases are.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXTRA LOOT:

(from Toadman527@aol.com)


"Secondly, while playing on easy, with Jill, you can find some shotgun 
shells right before your first battle with the giant snake. Right after 
you enter the loft area with the snake (before he comes out), you can 
search the boxes by the door to find some regular shotgun shells. Nothin 
extraordinary, but every little bit helps."


I feel stupid for missing those!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

DUN DUN! Out pops Yawn again! The bastard never gives up...and you can't 
run away this time! 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 BOSS -- Yawn the Python, strikes back!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

First you need to turn yourself around and get down that ladder as 
quickly as you can. If you stay up on this ledge, Yawn can actually 
SWALLOW you in one bite -- not pretty. All right, here's a strategy that 
I've found works GREAT: 
 
Time for a little game of "Run Around the Mulberry Bush" with Yawny boy.

            .----------------.----------------------------.
            |          Ladder|                            |

            '--------'------------------------------------'
      

Make sure to equip your Grenade Launcher filled with Acid Shells. Now, 
get Yawn to follow behind you as you run from the bottom of the ladder, 
and run COUNTER-clockwise around the shelf. Don't run too fast, as you 
want Yawn to follow at a comfortable distance. Once you run BACK to 
point (1), whip around and wait. To the right of you Yawn's tail should 
be wagging in the breeze, and Yawn should rear up and come after you 
from behind the shelf. FIRE AT WILL! When Yawn gets too close for 
comfort, run around the shelf again...

Hitting Yawn's head and "neck" brings him down faster than injuring the 
length of his body. If you run out of grenades, finish him off with 
Handgun rounds. If you don't have the Grenade Launcher to begin 
with...well...use the Handgun, but it'll take a WHILE longer.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The death animation of Yawn is quite gruesome (and he's DEAD FOR GOOD), 
causing some books on the nearby shelf to be thrown to the floor. But 
more importantly a sparkle is revealed! Run behind the shelf and pick up 
the sparkle -- LAST BOOK VOL.2 -- and just like the first book, examine 
the long side of the pages on the status screen. You'll pull out a MEDAL 
OF WOLF. Now head back up the ladder, and backtrack to the beginning. 
Exit out the door...

KNIGHTS' HALLWAY
--------------------

Head down to the beginning and exit out.

YELLOW CORRIDOR
-------------------

Run forward, then turn and head through the gap with the mirror. Exit 
through the first door here.

WEST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

Run forward, then trot on down the stairs...

BOTTOM OF WEST STAIRS
-------------------------

Use the door off to the side at the bottom. Save room time!

DRUG ROOM
-------------

Deposit ALL the items you picked up in the box. You just need a Handgun, 
Handgun ammo, the Helmet Key, and a fully-loaded Shotgun. The Shotgun is 
basically just for emergencies. Feel free to SAVE YOUR GAME, just 
remember to redeposit the Ink Ribbon in the Item Box. Exit the room...

BOTTOM OF WEST STAIRS
-------------------------

Trot back up the stairs. *creak creak*

WEST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

Head to the right, and open the nearby side door with your Helmet Key. 
Enter inside...can you feel the anticipation?!

EAGLE STATUETTE ROOM
------------------------

Grab the GRENADE SHELLS on you right, on the shelf below the Deer head. 
Run to the other side of the room, and grab the DAGGER sitting to the 
left of the Buffalo head. Trot over to that table between the two 
dressers and pick up a "Mail from the Chief of Security" file. It's 
puzzle time!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            GEMSTONE PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you should have already noticed (unless you're blind) that Eagle 
Statuette follows you whenever you run around the room. Suspicious? Yes. 
So what are we going to do about it? Simple. Run back to the door, and 
flick the light switch beside it to turn the lights off in the room. The 
eyes in the Eagle glow bright purple. An eye in the Deer head glows red, 
and an eye in Buffalo head glows yellow. 

Push both of the cabinets forward so they're against the walls and 
underneath the animal heads. Now, here's the trick with the Eagle:

• The Eagle will lock on and follow you if you're running in its VIEW.

• If you run AGAINST the wall on which the Eagle is mounted, you'll pass
  BELOW its view, causing it not to follow you.

Now, get the Eagle to lock on to the Buffalo head (the eyes will flash). 
Pass below the Eagle, then quickly hop on top of the cabinet below the 
Deer head and examine the head. Take out the RED GEMSTONE. Now just 
repeat this process, but opposite, for the Buffalo to get the YELLOW 
GEMSTONE. Now you can take your pansy self outta here...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

WEST STAIRS HALLWAY
----------------------- 

Head left, then run down the stairs.

BOTTOM OF WEST STAIRS
-------------------------

Arm yourself with a Shotgun (just incase) then run forward and around 
the pillar. Round the corner...you'll be having lunch with two Hunters 
in a matter of moments. Run forward past the first window -- SHATTER. 
Hunter number one pops in. Run past the other window -- SHATTER. Another 
Hunter pops in. Run your little Jill legs to the end of the hall and 
exit out the END door.

LONG WINDOW HALLWAY
-----------------------

Immediately turn left and run down the way. Turn left, into that little 
alcove piece. Use the door...

TIGER ALTAR ROOM
--------------------

Position yourself in front of the Tiger Statue and place in the Yellow 
Gemstone. It'll revolve and give up an MO DISK. This we'll use in a bit. 
Exit the room.

LONG WINDOW HALLWAY
-----------------------

Run out of the little alcove, then turn left, and run down that long 
strip of hallway. Exit out the end door.

KENNETH HALLWAY
-------------------

Trot to the right and use the door.

DINING ROOM
---------------

Turn right, running down along the table. Use the double doors.

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Run yourself straight across the room to the double doors on the 
opposite side. Use your Helmet Key and open the single door just to the 
left. Discard the key and enter...

SCIENCE ROOM
----------------

Off to your right you should notice that jar housing a green liquid and 
a human digestive system. But more importantly, pick up the "undated 
note" sitting beside the jar. Speaks something about an "art room." Head 
around the shelves and turn left. Run to the end and examine the 
bookcase to get some INK RIBBON. Flip around, then run down this hall 
and use the door. 

WARDROBE ROOM                
-----------------     

Oooh, a Zombie! Get around him, and in the area opposite the mirror we 
have GREEN HERB and a BLUE HERB TERRACE. Grab the DAGGER on the floor, 
then the JEWELRY BOX sitting in the cabinet. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              JIGSAW PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We had every puzzle-type except the classic jigsaw. You knew it was 
coming! The impression on the top of the Jewelry Box is in the shape of 
an octagon. You have to arrange the pieces so they fit perfectly inside. 
The easiest way is to start with the largest piece and work your way 
down in size. Piece 2 goes in the very center, e.g. the last one you 
use. All the pieces:
                                  __
                                 /  \
         _____                  /    \                       _
        /    /                  \     \                     / \
       /    /      ___           |     |        __         /   \
      / 1  /      /   \          |     |       /  \       /     \
      \   |      /     \     ____|  3  |      /    \      |     |
       \  |     /   2   \   |          |     /  4   \     |  5  |
        \ |    |        /   |         /     /       /     |     |
         \|    |_______/    |________/     /_______/     /_______\


But if you want a better full-color image of the solution, which puts my 
crappy ascii to shame, you can see DEngel's "Jewel Box Puzzle Solution" 
at this location:

http://db.gamefaqs.com/console/gamecube/file/resident_evil_jewel_box.gif

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

With the puzzle solved, the Jewelry Box opens, revealing a BROACH. 
Examine the Broach further (press A), and at the bottom out folds a key. 
We have the EMBLEM KEY, the final key in the Mansion. Wew. Now leave the 
room before that Zombie gives yah a hug.

SCIENCE ROOM
----------------

Run down the hall then turn right, exiting out the door.

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Head to the main stairs. Run up one set of stairs then use the painted 
door to exit out.

GRAVEYARD
-------------

Head down the stairs, round the corner, and head down even more stairs. 
Run over to that gate and exit.

PORTRAIT GALLERY
--------------------

Run your legs all the way to the other end and use the door.

EAST HALLWAY
----------------

If you haven't done so already, equip a Shotgun and pump the Hunter in 
front of you full of lead. Now watch, point, and laugh as his body 
convulses and dies. Dance with it -- DANCE I SAID, DANCE! ;) Now run to 
the gray door with the emblem on it. Open it with your Emblem Key (yah, 
really). Discard the key and enter inside.

SPENCERS' ROOM
------------------

If you examine the things in the room, the game will tell you it's too 
dark to see anything. But before you run back to get your Lighter, walk 
to the desk and examine the lamp. Press "yes" to turn it on! That fooled 
me the first time! Examine the shelf just LEFT of the lamp to reveal 
some well hidden SHOTGUN SHELLS. Now turn around, and on that small 
cabinet, grab the BATTERY PACK on one corner, and the ever-elusive and 
spiffy METAL OBJECT. Doesn't the object look familiar?! Exit the room.

EAST HALLWAY
----------------

Take the door to the right of you beside the chair.

BOTTOM OF EAST STAIRS
-------------------------

Run forward, and kill this Hunter here as well (dance...), then take the 
door at the bottom of the stairs.

EAST STAIRS STORAGE ROOM
----------------------------

Deposit EVERYTHING in the box. SAVE YOUR GAME, then redeposit the Ink 
Ribbon. Now, you need: fully-loaded Shotgun, Shotgun shells, Square 
Crank, and your Battery. DON'T forget anything! Exit the room...

BOTTOM OF EAST STAIRS
-------------------------

Head around the corner and use the door at the end.

EAST HALLWAY
----------------

Head left, round the corner, and exit out the metal door. Fresh air...

VINE PASSAGE
----------------

Run along it to the end and use the metal door.

GARDEN SUPPLY SHED
----------------------

Head forward and use the wooden double doors.

PILLAR COURTYARD
--------------------

If Cerberus are still here, clean them ALL out with your Shotgun before 
moving on. Head up the stairs and use the gate.

STORAGE POOL
----------------

Pop down the ladder, running along the bottom. Use the other ladder then 
run along the path (watch the Snake by the lamp) to the lift.

WATERFALL COURTYARD
-----------------------

Pace...pace...pace. Two Cerberus are here (unless you killed them WAY 
before, while exiting the Residence) The goal is to make sure BOTH of 
them don't gang up on you at the same time. With Shotgun in hand, run 
kamikaze at the first dog, which is taking a nap to the left of the 
waterfall. BANG! Now run between the pillars and down the steps (if the 
other dog hasn't already spotted you). Dog -- BANG! Beside the fountain 
is another lift...yet, it has no power and there's a strange box beside 
it spiting out sparks. Hyuk hyuk! Place your Battery in the box to 
restart the power. Ride the lift up...

PILLAR COURTYARD
--------------------

We went in a circle -- how quaint. Run along this corridor then head 
around the pillars. Use the steps and the metal gate again...

STORAGE POOL
----------------

Run forward then go off to the right. Use your Square Crank on the hole 
again, filling the pool with water. The game says a waterfall has 
stopped. Duh...hint? Flip around then exit out the gate.

PILLAR COURTYARD
--------------------

Head down the stairs, round the pillars, then run and use the lift...

WATERFALL COURTYARD
-----------------------

Trot up the steps then run over to where the waterfall use to be. 
Surprise surprise, a passage has been uncovered in the back after the 
water was drained. Head in.

BEHIND THE WATERFALL
------------------------

Run down the long passage and use the ladder at the end. Candles? Who 
lit candles? Ahem... :p

MINING AREA -- MAIN TUNNEL
------------------------------

I hate this part. I repeat, I hate this part. It has got to be the most 
BORING part of the ENTIRE game! Whoever designed it should be fired! You 
could run forward and find a TYPEWRITER, ITEM BOX, and a dead end. Or, 
you could just take that side door -- which is what you should do!

MINING AREA -- WINDY TUNNEL
-------------------------------

Run forward, then turn left. There's a huge boulder with wind blowing 
out from behind it. Grab the ACID SHELLS sitting on the floor. Turn 
around, trot down the stairs, and use the door at the end.

MINING AREA -- INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR
--------------------------------------

Head just to the left and grab the HANDGUN MAGAZINE on the floor. That 
gapping hole is the elevator (or at least where it should be...). Run 
around the elevator, then head into that alcove with the machinery. 
Examine that square panel, the main power console. Say "yes" to removing 
the SHAFT. No jokes please... ;) Run out of the alcove and head down 
that corridor...grab the HANDGUN MAGAZINE in the pool of water (quite 
hard to see) then use the door.

MINING AREA -- ENRICO TUNNEL
--------------------------------

Trot forward a bit and a cutscene automatically starts playing. We meet 
Enrico, another fellow S.T.A.R.S. officer:

"S.T.A.R.S. is finished." 
"Umbrella set us up."

No, no, tell use what you REALLY feel (LOL)! And then BANG, he's dead 
with a handgun blast to the heart. Examine Enrico's body and Jill will 
find he's holding something -- a CRANK. Examine its tip so it's renamed 
HEXAGON CRANK. 

Make SURE to have your Shotgun equipped, then head back to the door. 
Right before you reach the door it swings open and a Hunter pops out. 
Kill him then exit...

MINING AREA -- INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR
--------------------------------------

Run down the hall, around the elevator, and exit out the other door.

MINING AREA -- WINDY TUNNEL
-------------------------------

Trot forward, then wait at the bottom of the stairs -- ANOTHER Hunter. 
Kill'em then exit out the door.

MINING AREA -- MAIN TUNNEL
------------------------------

Follow the around the corner. Ah, safety. Grab the INK RIBBON sitting by 
the Typewriter, and SAVE your game. Now deposit everything away, just 
make sure to have a Grenade Launcher filled with Acid Shells, extra Acid 
Shells, and your Hexagon Crank. Go around the next corner and you find 
the dead end -- but there's a panel on the left wall with a hexagonal-
shaped hole. I wonder; use your crank on it, causing the tunnel section 
to flip over. Run across the path, and grab that GREEN HERB in the 
corner before exiting out the door.

MINING AREA -- BOULDER TUNNEL
---------------------------------

To the left is a dead end, but to the right is a suspicious boulder 
blocking the passage. Run over to the boulder and check it...flip around 
and begin to walk away. KATHUNK! The boulder has broken lose and will 
kill you instantly if it touches you! Run down the tunnel and duck into 
the alcove with the door. If you don't feel like Indiana Jones now, you 
never will. 

After that danger is done, run back to where the boulder originally was 
for some well hidden SHOTGUN SHELLS. Turn around and run the other 
direction -- the boulder has broken a new passage -- exit out the door.

NOTE: Clearly I was equipped with a Grenade Launcher. But when Jill
      dived into the alcove she wasn't holding a weapon. LAZY Capcom!

MINING AREA -- SPIDERS' NEST
--------------------------------

Holy fruit salad! Everything is covered in spiderwebs, and from the 
ceiling a GIGANTIC Spider crawls down. Boss time...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          BOSS -- Queen Spider
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wow! This is so freaking easy it's unbelievable! Don't move...don't even 
breath. Just stand in place and fire a few acid rounds at the Queen 
Spider. Don't worry if she nails you with acid spit, you have a Green 
Herb and there's a Blue Herb in the next tunnel. It only takes a few 
grenades and the Queen will roll over and die faster than the French in 
World War II.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The major threat is over, but there's still two "normal" (whatever that 
is) Giant Spiders in the room. I usually use a few grenades and take 
them both out, because they're highly annoying. 

NOTE: If you check out the Queen Spider's body, her abdomen should have
      been ruptured. Tons of tiny Spiders are pouring out -- you can
      squish them! Good for satisfying a perverse nature (or at least
      mine). Heh. :p 

Run over to the wooden crates and grab the sparkle, a SURVIVAL KNIFE. 
YEAH! Wait, a, second...that's crappy! See, Capcom was extremely kind 
with you by not making you run all the way back to the Item Box to get 
your original Survival Knife. You need to use this knife and slash away 
the spider web strands that are blocking the door. After you're done 
cleaning, exit out.

MINING AREA -- SIDE TUNNEL
------------------------------

Run to the left, where there's a dead end with some BLUE HERB. Also grab 
the B1 COURTYARD MAP posted on the bulletin board. Turn around and head 
the other way. Use the door and exit.

MINING AREA -- ANOTHER BOULDER TUNNEL
-----------------------------------------

Run forward and go around the corner. We're greeted with the familiar 
sight of a dead end and a hexagonal hole panel. Use your crank on the 
hole to flip the tunnel -- except use it THREE TIMES. After the third 
time (remember to exit your status screen) the boulder across the way 
breaks lose. 

RUN JILL RUN! Turn around and run down the tunnel, ducking around the 
corner. Wew...round the corner again, and run down ALL THE WAY to the 
end. In this little area that was blocked by the boulder we find a FIRST 
AID BOX, which when examined gives you a FIRST AID SPRAY. Turn around, 
and take the side tunnel. Exit out the door.

MINING AREA -- GODDESS STATUE CHAMBER
-----------------------------------------

We have another puzzle here. The object of it is to get that loose 
Goddess Statue positioned by the wall, and push it over and into the 
alcove by the other statue.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             GODDESS PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

• Push the loose statue along the wall to the right, so it rests in
  front of that dark panel.

• Use your Hexagon Crank on the hole by the door. The dark panel will
  move out into the room, pushing the statue.

• Use your crank a second time, retracting the dark panel.

• Run over to the Goddess Statue and push it towards that circle panel
  on the floor, then push it FORWARD onto the circle. The statue will
  turn 90 degrees.

• Move the statue off the circle panel, then push it back on by pushing
  it FORWARD. The statue turns another 90 degrees.

• Now just move the statue over into the alcove!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

GOD the camera angles make that puzzle almost unbearable! After the 
statue is back in its alcove the center panel raises revealing an item. 
Pick up the CYLINDER. The next task is just to backtrack all the way to 
the Main Tunnel (place with the Typewriter). I'm sure you'll manage...

MINING AREA -- MAIN TUNNEL
------------------------------

Deposit everything in the Item Box EXCEPT the Cylinder, then take out 
the Shaft. Combine the Cylinder and Shaft on your status screen to get a 
CYLINDER SHAFT (there's so many jokes I could crack right about now). 
Examine the Cylinder Shaft further on the status screen and the game 
will tell you if you want to turn it...say "yes." Turn it enough times 
and on the curved side four Roman numerals will be formed:

                           IV   II   III   I

Which is 4, 2, 3, 1, for you "challenged" people. All you should have in 
your inventory is the Cylinder Shaft and maybe a First Aid Spray just 
incase. You might want too SAVE YOUR GAME too. Head around the corner 
and use the door by the ladder. 

MINING AREA -- WINDY TUNNEL
-------------------------------

Round the corner, trot down the steps, and use the door at the bottom.

MINING AREA -- INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR
--------------------------------------

Run around the elevator and head into the alcove. Place the Cylinder 
Shaft into the main console on the machinery -- you have to get around a 
little security feature consisting of four buttons. The solution is so 
obvious I wouldn't even bother telling you...

...alright, alright. Press buttons 4, 2, 3, 1.  ;) 

The power is restored to the elevator, and it raises itself to your 
level. Run on to the elevator and examine the console -- say "yes" to go 
down. Barry magically shows up (lead down here by a sound; yeah, my 
ass), and decides to ride down with you...

MINING BRIDGE
-----------------

After the elevator stops Barry hears a sound in the next room (haven't 
we heard that somewhere before...). Barry stays behind while you're 
supposed to go ahead. Oh brother. Get off the elevator and run forward, 
using the door.

CIRCULAR TUNNEL COMPLEX
---------------------------

Head down the tunnel and midway you hear a door swing open. Hmmm...keep 
going, and at the fork go right -- LISA TREVOR! AHH MOMMY! She appears 
whichever direction you take first. Turn around and head left, following 
the circular tunnel (don't turn in that little side tunnel) and trot up 
the stairs. Take the door in the alcove.

CARGO UPLOAD
----------------

There's lots of cargo crates around, hence the name. Head forward and go 
around the corner to the next little area. In the other corner you 
should notice a massive stack of crates. Climb the first (tan) crate, 
then climb up the next (green) crate, then run up the brown bags. At the 
very top you hit the motherload -- a BATTERY PACK, HANDGUN MAGAZINE, and 
MAGNUM ROUNDS. *faints*

Get back down to the ground, and see that brown crate? Push it slightly 
to the left then forward onto the materials lift. Examine the console, 
sending it on it's way. You may exit now.

CIRCULAR TUNNEL COMPLEX
---------------------------

Head to the right, there appears Lisa Trevor. So turn around and take 
the left tunnel (keep in mind that switch on the wall that you pass) and 
turn into the exit tunnel. Follow it to the end and use the door.

MINING BRIDGE
-----------------

Arg...Barry takes the elevator and leaves you there. Surprise surprise. 
Guess we're taking the back way -- cross the bridge (Item Box), and 
climb down the ladder at the end.

MATERIALS DROPOFF POINT
---------------------------

Head to the left -- there's your crate on the lift. Push it left, off 
the elevator. Then push it forward so it drops into that "pit." Examine 
the console and turn on the "Garbage Compactor." Classic. The crate is 
crushed, revealing a shiny item, which you should hop down and collect. 
The BROKEN FLAMETHROWER! Get out of this pit and take the ladder again.

MINING BRIDGE
----------------- 

Cross the bridge and use the door by the elevator again.

CIRCULAR TUNNEL COMPLEX
---------------------------

Run down the first tunnel to the end...OK, this is where we can actually 
manipulate Lisa Trevor to our own ends. Turn left, and she'll appear. 
Now go to the right. Around the first corner you should see lever on the 
wall. IGNORE IT FOR RIGHT NOW! Wait in front of it; Lisa Trevor will 
slink over. Right as she's breathing down your neck, hit that funky 
lever -- nearby a panel sprouts two hooks.

NOTE: You're probably wondering why we waited till the last minute to
      hit the lever. It's simple really, we don't want Lisa giving us a
      birthday surprise and going the other way through the tunnel
      rather than following behind.  

The hooks don't last forever (time limit), so run to the right, head 
down the stairs, and turn into that side tunnel -- here's the panel with 
hooks and a door. Use your Broken Flamethrower on the hooks and the door 
unlocks. Exit out.

LISA TREVOR'S HOME
----------------------

Head forward and enter through the gate. This places looks like a cross 
between "Child's Play" (Chucky) and "Indiana Jones and the Temple of 
Doom"! Run around the center structure of wood and candles then enter 
the partly submerged tunnel. MOVE IT! This place is swarming with 
snakes. Once you reach the end you come to another candlelight room -- 
check off to your left. 

Grab the JEWELRY BOX sitting on the shelf, and examine its lid on your 
status screen to take out a STONE RING. You also get "A family picture 
and notes" file. Grab the DAGGER laying on the bed and climb up the 
ladder. At the top head to the left and climb up another ladder to exit 
outside.

NOTE: If you got poisoned by the Snakes in the water tunnel, head to the
      right to find a dead end, some water barrels, and a BLUE HERB.  

CABIN
---------

Aha! I always thought that board looked suspicious ever since we got the 
Square Crank! Head down the dusty hall and pull yourself up to the 
wooden floor. Check the Item Box at the end and pull out your Metal 
Object. Combine the Metal Object with the Stone Ring on your status 
screen to get -- brace yourself -- a second STONE & METAL OBJECT. Tadah! 

Your can deposit everything else from your inventory in the box, just 
make sure to keep the Stone & Metal Object. Now all you have to do is 
make your way back to the Garden Supply Shed in the Mansion...it's a 
straight line, very easy...

Trot over to the shelf depression on the wall and remove the second 
STONE & METAL OBJECT. The door subsequently locks behind you. You should 
now have two of the octagonal beauties. Follow the passage and exit out 
the other door.

EAST HALLWAY
----------------

Run down the hall piece and exit out the door in the corner.

PORTRAIT GALLERY
--------------------

Follow the hall to the end and use the gate.

GRAVEYARD
-------------

Head right, trot up both sets of stairs, then use the door.

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

If you did any exploring in this room earlier in the game, you should 
remember that locked gate beneath the stairs. Head down this set of 
stairs, then go either left or right and head down another set of 
stairs...you come to a little hallway. Examine the large gate in the 
center -- it's locked, for now at least. Place in BOTH of your Stone & 
Metal Objects, causing them to fit snugly in each door. Head through.

SPECIALTY ITEMS TO COLLECT:
-------------------------------

1. Barry's 44 Magnum  (optional)



STAIRWAY PASSAGE
--------------------

This place is TINY, and you wouldn't be spending much time here. At the 
top of the stairs is a TYPEWRITER and at the bottom is an ITEM BOX. You 
should take out a fully-loaded Magnum Revolver, a First Aid Spray, your 
Medal of Eagle, and your Medal of Wolf. Make sure to SAVE YOUR GAME! 
Head down several sets of stairs, and at the bottom follow the haphazard 
catwalk. Use the door at the end.

INNER SANCTUM TUNNEL
------------------------

Even more candles! Run down the steps and at the bottom descend the 
ladder. Prepare yourself...

THE TOMB
------------

Here we find Barry working over a stone casket and preparing some rope 
and pulley system. After the pudgy fool notices Jill he tries to pull a 
gun on her...but she quickly counters and grabs it out of his hand. In 
comes Lisa Trevor, in all her mutanagenic-glory (check out the eyeball 
on her back!) and the gate locks behind her. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       Give the gun back to Barry?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may not realize it now, but how you answer this question will effect 
•MANY• things later on...

NO:
-------

If you choose to be a selfish bastard and not return the gun, a cutscene 
will play showing Lisa Trevor knocking Jill to the floor. Barry 
intervenes, but Lisa ends up knocking him into the pit to his demise. A 
sparkle gets left behind from Barry -- the "Barry's Photograph" file. 
The caption on the back of the photo, a sickeningly sweet memoir from 
his daughters Moira and Polly, is enough to make you regret your 
decision. BUT, you also get to keep "Barry's 44 Magnum" which is very 
powerful weapon that comes with 6 rounds (no extra ammo), and will waste 
almost any enemy in a few shots, including the final boss.

YES:
--------

Ah! So you want to be kind and generous like every other hero? Well you 
will be richly rewarded! Not only does Barry survive, but he also helps 
you against Lisa Trevor in the upcoming battle. This provides a great 
distraction allowing you to deal Lisa the final blow. Plus, if Barry 
stays alive you get to play the ultra-cool, must-be-seen second battle 
of the final boss...you MUST experience it at least once! The guide will 
assume you gave Barry his gun back. 

CONCLUSION:
---------------

All in all, I almost ALWAYS pick "yes." The rewards are much BETTER! The 
only times I ever picked "no" was when I was doing a speed run.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  BOSS -- Lisa Trevor, back for more!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you make the gun decision you have to fight Lisa Trevor, AGAIN. 
Don't worry, she wouldn't be coming back after this! There are two 
strategies for this boss. The "stones" one tends to be much easier, 
doesn't give you a migraine, and you don't have to waste any ammo!

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
MAGNUM POWER

This is SO much easier with Barry alive, since he'll provide a nice 
distraction after taking his position beneath the ladder. Careful, Lisa 
Trevor can still knock him into the pit! That would suck, Barry dies and 
you don't even get to keep his gun! Well, I've tried every weapon I can 
think of against Lisa (launcher, handgun, shotgun, ect.) and the MAGNUM 
REVOLVER is the only one that works well.  

• When Lisa is near a platform edge, shoot •low• at her LEGS to knock
  her off...she'll hold on the edge.

• Now aim •low• and hit her in the skull. Wave bubye...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
STONES 

See those four stones at each corner of the platform? Well all you have 
to do is push them off and into the pit. A cool trick I learned is you 
can actually get Lisa Trevor to knock them off! Stand in front of a 
stone, and wait for Lisa to slink over...right as she's about to smack 
you, GET OUT OF THE WAY! Hopefully she'll hit the stone send it flying.

Whichever way you use, once all four stones are gone, the stone casket 
will open, revealing Lisa's mother. Lisa takes the skull and then jumps 
into the pit...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, didn't those strategies make the other guides look like melted 
cheese? :p After the gate retracts, exit through. Run down the tunnel 
and take the elevator at the end.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            C O U R T Y A R D
------------------------------------------------------------------------



FOUNTAIN MONUMENT
---------------------

Run forward and round the corner. Here we have a large pool of water. 
There are two places along the wall of the pool that have ornate 
decoration -- place your Medal of Eagle and Medal of Wolf in these 
places. Two hidden doors open draining out the water. Find the gap in 
the wall, head through, then trot down the stairs. Press A to take the 
elevator you find at the bottom.

• SWITCH TO DISK 2...highly illogical. I mean, why not have a disk per
  character, or something that actually makes sense? And the disk is a 
  terribly hard to get out of the game case -- it feels like I'm going
  to BREAK THE DANG THING!



------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          L A B O R A T O R Y 
------------------------------------------------------------------------



SPECIALTY ITEMS TO COLLECT:
-------------------------------

1. Ink Ribbon                11. Fuel Supply Capsule
2. MO Disk                   12. Fuse Unit
3. X-Ray of CLARK            13. Signal Rockets
4. X-Ray of GAIL             14. Rocket Launcher
5. Ink Ribbon
6. Slide Filter
7. MO Disk
8. Laboratory Map
9. Key for the Power Area    
10. Ink Ribbon



MACHINERY ROOM
------------------

In this area, all loose-ends in the story are tied, all rights are 
wronged, and we get to fight a mean final boss! This area should take 
about 20 minutes to complete. 25 minutes if you're going to complete the 
MO Disk scenario (which WILL be covered in the guide). Head around the 
machine at the center of the room and take the ladder in the alcove.

LAB ENTRANCE
----------------

Nab the INK RIBBON sitting at your feet, and you should obviously SAVE 
your game using the TYPEWRITER. Beside it is an ITEM BOX, and in your 
inventory you should have a First Aid Spray and a fully-loaded Shotgun. 
Take the double doors at the end.

UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR
---------------------

Many Zombies in this hall, so be careful, but DON'T KILL THEM. Head down 
this hallway and round the corner. Head down, and turn left, where a 
sparkle awaits you at the end on top of a pile of debris -- an MO DISK. 
Collect it and head right, trotting down the stairs. At the bottom use 
the double doors.  

DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR
-----------------------

Turn right, and use the other door. 

PATIENT HALLWAY
-------------------

Collect that FIRST AID BOX at your feet and examine it to get MIXED 
HERB, containing two Green Herb. Take the door just to your left.

ROENTGENOGRAM ROOM
----------------------

Run over and grab the sparkle sitting on the box, an X-RAY. If you 
examine it on the status screen, you'll find it belongs to somebody 
named "Clark David". Subsequently the X-ray is renamed X-RAY OF CLARK. 

Trot farther into the room and examine the computer setup to the right. 
You get a "Researcher's letter"; read the whole thing for some good 
background info. You also learn a screename and password to access the 
Umbrella computer system, which flashes on screen when you're done:

                          "...JOHN......ADA..." 

Check the bulletin board to the left to get another X-RAY. Examine it. 
This one belongs "Gail Holland" and is renamed X-RAY OF GAIL. You also 
find a note:

"To use the electronic door, place the initials in alphabetical order."

*sniff sniff* I smell a puzzle! 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              X-RAY PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The whole goal of this puzzle is to determine the password that will 
allow you to unlock the door on basement floor 2 (remember it mentioned 
in the letter) via the Umbrella computer system. If you observe the 
diagram on the bulletin board, you'll notice human organs. Take note of 
their locations:

• Esophagus
• Lungs
• Liver
• Stomach
• Large Intestine
• Small Intestine
• Colon

Now, on the other board (where there's already two X-rays up), place the 
X-Ray of Clark in the left blank, and the X-Ray of Gail in the right 
blank. Which strangely, makes them in alphabetic order of ABCDEFGH. ;) 
Now run back to the door, and on the wall beside it, hit the light 
switch -- the room glows in a red light, and highlights a portion of 
each X-Ray in red.

The organs that glowed red, from left to right, were: Colon, Esophagus, 
Liver, Lungs. If you take the first letter of each organ, you end up 
with the word "CELL."

Password to Basement Floor 2: CELL 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now all you have to do is exit the room. Amazing, yes?

PATIENT HALLWAY
------------------

Take the door adjacent to you...

DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR
-----------------------

Run forward and head down that narrow tunnel. There's a ZOMBIE in here, 
and barely any room to maneuver, so be careful. At the end of the tunnel 
take the double doors off to the left.

MEDICAL RESEARCH LAB
------------------------

What the hell happened here? Blood streaks on the floor with cockroaches 
all over them? Trot forward from the door and check that console on the 
left wall -- it's beside that "arm" thing. You get some MAGNUM ROUNDS. 
Trot to the other side of the room and enter through that little door to 
the freezer...hey how's it hangin' guys (couldn't resist). Check the 
sparkles on the shelf for a BATTERY PACK and a FIRST AID BOX -- examine 
the box for a GREEN HERB. That's kinda sucky! I usually just use it 
right away so it doesn't clutter the inventory. Exit the freezer and 
trot over to the computer desk. Check just to the right of the PC for a 
"V-ACT" file. Now examine the computer... 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              l33t h4x0r !
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the login screen pops up, type in:

Login:    JOHN
Password: ADA

• When the floor selection screen comes up, select the second basement
  floor to unlock it. Password: CELL 

• Select the third floor and unlock that too.

• You can now "cancel" and "quit."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can exit the room now...

DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR
-----------------------

Head right, run down the tunnel, and take the double doors straight 
across the way (NOT the one to the stairs).

PATIENT HALLWAY
-------------------

Run down the hall and take the green door off to the right.

CHEMISTRY RESEARCH LAB
--------------------------

Grab the INK RIBBON on the chair. Run forward, and on the counter grab 
that circular container with the red lid -- the SLIDE FILTER. Round the 
corner to the next area, ZOMBIE! Get around it and grab the sparkle on 
the side desk; a "FAX" file. Check the main desk to find a GameCubesque 
Data Reader, which you should use your MO Disk on (you should have one 
in your inventory; got it in the Upstairs Corridor). One of the locks on 
a security door is green-lighted. Now exit the room before that Zombie 
gives you a hug... 

PATIENT HALLWAY
-------------------

Head left, running down the hall. Use the double green doors.

DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR
----------------------

Take the grated double doors adjacent to you.

UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR
---------------------

Run up the stairs, and at the top run parallel to the stairs, head 
around the corner, and use the door at the end.

LAB ENTRANCE
----------------

Ditch all the supplies you collected -- just keep your fully-loaded 
Shotgun and the Slide Filter. Take out the MO Disk you stored in the 
Item Box from earlier (from the mansion; yellow gemstone). Exit out 
using the doors. 

UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR
---------------------

Run down the hall, then go around the corner. Run down this hall and 
turn left. Take the double doors, as they're open now! 

VISUAL DATA ROOM
--------------------

Just to the right of the door (on the bookcase), grab the (last) MO DISK 
sparkling like nobody's business. You should have two MO Disk in your 
inventory now. Just to the left of the door (on the glass case), examine 
it to get a LABORATORY MAP. Grab the FIRST AID SPRAY on the end of the 
table. Trot around the table, and on the other side you find a projector 
-- use your Slide Filter on it, allowing you to view the Umbrella 
briefing in a sexy red tint. 

Scroll through slides of the different "Bio-Organic Weapons" (hey, I 
didn't just make up these enemy names!) and at the end you get to see a 
picture of the development team. The very last slide shows a bar-code, 
but only four numbers are visible: 8642.

NOTE: On the slide of the development team, did you notice Wesker
      standing on the right side? Ahem... ;) 

SECOND NOTE: If you viewed the slides without the Slide Filter, they
             would have appeared white. At the end the bar-code would be
             complete, meaning you wouldn't get the special combination.
             On HARD MODE the combination is different...

Run back to the door. To the right of it on a pillar you should notice 
the keypad (has a light on top of it). Examine the keypad and input 
"8462" -- nearby, a hidden door will open. Oh, a secret room behind a 
mirror! Clever! *cough* Run over to where the door is, and examine the 
•tall• bookcase to find a "Security Protocols" file. Examine the •low• 
bookcase to find some SHOTGUN SHELLS. 

Head through the door, and grab the LABORATORY KEY. Examine it and it's 
renamed KEY FOR THE POWER AREA. On the opposite wall is a VCR where you 
can view Kenneth's Film that you got WAY back in the beginning of the 
game. But the film really pisses me off:

• He's a highly-trained S.T.A.R.S. police officer.
• He's got a weapon.
• It's a SHOTGUN.
• HE'S FACING •ONE• ZOMBIE AND IT'S TEN FEET AWAY!

GAH! If I was there, not only would the Zombie be dead, but I'd be 
wearing it's head as a hat! Well, you can completely exit this room now, 
we're done here...

UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR
---------------------

Run down the hall piece then trot down the steps. Use the double doors 
at the bottom.

DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR
-----------------------

Run forward and down the hall. Dodge the Zombie and go right around the 
corner, where you find some medical supplies -- check the cabinet for a 
DAGGER and the medical gurney (bed) for a HANDGUN MAGAZINE. Keep going 
down this hall and take the double doors on the left. After you unlock 
it with your Key for the Power Area, head in.

COLD STORAGE
----------------

Those various "grunts" and "growls" are from the Chimera enemy, which 
basically looks like a skinned human with many insect limbs. They're 
dangerous only if you're not prepared, but you have (SHOULD HAVE) a 
Shotgun equipped. Run forward and push that shelf unit forward. To your 
left collect the SHOTGUN SHELLS on the shelf, and climb up on the ledge 
to your right. Examine (press A) against that hole high up on the wall 
(it's an air vent). 

AUTOPSY ROOM
---------------- 

You've climbed through! But don't stick around here unless you like 
being lunch for a Chimera. Run along the countertop to the air vent 
right beside you and climb through.

COLD STORAGE
----------------

Make this QUICK -- Chimeras can pop in through the vent. Hop down from 
the ledge and run along the body bags. On the counter in the corner, 
check it to find another GameCubesque Data Reader -- use an MO Disk to 
green-light another lock on the security door. Flip around, and run 
along the other side of the body bags. Push forward the shelf unit then 
exit out the door on the right.

DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR
-----------------------

Turn to the left and unlock the door in the corner. Discard your Key for 
the Power Area and head through.

BRANCHED HALLWAY
--------------------

Run forward down the hall and take the door straight across.

LAB LOUNGE
--------------

Look at the bag of goodies in this room (no jokes :P )! Grab all the 
stuff waiting for you, especially the INK RIBBON beside the TYPEWRITER. 
I'd SAVE your game if I were you. But if I were you, you'd be me, and 
then I'd use your body to tell you to tell me to save. *goes cross-eyed* 
In your inventory, you should have a fully-loaded Grenade Launcher, and 
your last MO Disk. Exit the lounge.

BRANCHED HALLWAY
--------------------

Turn left and trot down the stairs. Ew, naked Zombie. Take the double 
doors at the end of the hall.

BOILER ROOM
--------------- 

You only have to kill ONE Chimera the entire time you're in here. Turn 
to the right (JILL'S RIGHT!), and run down and round the corner. A 
Chimera is waiting at the other end of this path -- NUKE'EM! Run down to 
where his body should be melting into a pile of gut juice and examine 
the blue light beside the "WARNING" sign. Take out the FUEL SUPPLY 
CAPSULE. It's empty and we need to fill it with fuel! The refueler is 
located in the "Chemistry Research Lab", the room with the first 
GameCubesque Data Reader. Once you backtrack...

CHEMISTRY RESEARCH LAB
--------------------------

From the door head around to the next area and examine that glass door. 
Say "yes" to put in the capsule, causing it to refill with fuel. 

The fuel contains a "nitro compound" -- if you run with it in your 
inventory you will EXPLODE! So walk. WALK. W-A-L-K!!! DO NOT RUN. 

Now •WALK• on back to the Boiler Room...

BOILER ROOM
---------------

Head right again, round the corner, and at the end press A in front of 
the blue light to set the Fuel Supply Capsule in place. We can now go to 
turn on the power. Flip around and run back to the door. From there head 
left, round the corner and run down -- CHIMERA -- use the door. 

BOILER HALLWAY
------------------

The Chimeras are endless! Immediately run STRAIGHT across. At the end 
you find the final GameCubesque Data Reader -- use your last MO Disk. 
Flip around and run back, this time taking the other path. Follow this 
path and RUN THE WHOLE TIME, those Chimeras will take you down if you're 
not careful. Use the double doors.

POWER ROOM
--------------

Even more Chimeras! Take either path and follow the catwalk around. In 
the back you find an alcove -- examine the console in it and say "yes" 
to turn on the power to the elevator. Now RUN back to the door! Exit, 
and you just need to backtrack to the "Branched Hallway."

BRANCHED HALLWAY
--------------------

Run forward, go up the steps, and take the door on the side.

LAB LOUNGE
--------------

Back in the save room; save your game and prepare for the MOTHER of all 
battles! Heal yourself so your health is in the "fine" condition. Now 
load up with:

• First Aid Spray
• First Aid Spray
• Grenade Launcher (10 shells minimum)
• Magnum Revolver (fully-loaded)
• Magnum rounds
• empty
• empty
• empty

                         Ready? Leave the room...

BRANCHED HALLWAY
--------------------

Head right and run down to the end -- here's the elevator. Examine the 
console on the right side of it to bring it up to you. Barry catches 
Jill just as she's about to go down...LOL. 

BIOHAZARD HALLWAY
---------------------

Go around the corner and use that spiffy futuristic door. It makes a 
"whoosh" like in Star Wars!

BIO-ORGANIC WEAPONS LABORATORY
----------------------------------

Watch the long-ass (yet INTERESTING) cutscenes. Everything is explained; 
Wesker, Barry, the Mansion, Umbrella Corporation, ect.

NOTE: Have you ever wondered why the hell RPGs have so many cutscenes? I
      mean for God's sakes, if you're going to have a LONG cutscene AT
      LEAST make it interesting! I was playing Breath of Fire 4 and
      nearly fell asleep...twice. 

Afterwards Wesker manages to release the 'Tyrant' from its water tube. 
Except Tyrant is "Premature!" as Wesker says, and Wesker gets smacked 
aside. Tyrant's awake. He's pissed. And he's after Jill...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          FINAL BOSS -- Tyrant 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This battle is much easier if you can use the layout of the lab to your 
advantage! Here's some ascii to help you:

           '------------------------------------------------'


"J" is where Jill starts out, and "T" is where Tyrant is. The key is to 
keep your distance from Tyrant, and not get trapped in either dead end 
with the door or the Electronic-Lock Console. Use grenades, then switch 
to Magnum rounds if you run out of ammo. Fire some ammo, run, fire 
again, run -- keep repeating the process while making laps around the 
block of Cryo Tanks (which by the way, look like they're housing 
Tyrant's cousins). After Tyrant "dies" (snicker) he'll fall over.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go visit Wesker knocked unconscious in the corner to get a precious 
"Observation Note" file. Everyone always misses that one! Now check 
Barry to wake him up (Wesker also disappears). Head over to the 
Electronic Lock Console and examine it to unlock the door. Take the door 
and exit out...

BIOHAZARD HALLWAY
---------------------

Seems Wesker has activated the Mansion self-destruct system! Jill and 
Barry both ride the elevator up.

BRANCHED HALLWAY
--------------------

After Barry runs on ahead, round the corner. Turn right at the fork and 
run down, using the door.

DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR
-----------------------

Chimeras are coming out of the air vents! RUN forward, then turn right 
at the corner and run down. Take the double doors off to the LEFT.

PATIENT HALLWAY
-------------------

Purdy lights. *has seizure* Head all the way to the other end -- the 
Security Door; if you used all three of the MO Disks on the GameCubesque 
Data Readers, then all three lights on the lock will be green. Press 
down all three of the levers. Head through the unlocked door...

HIDDEN CORRIDOR 
------------------- 

Run down the stairs and go around the corner. Open the door.

CHRIS' PRISON CELL
----------------------

Sure the toilet is bad, and the bed is filthy, but at least there's no 
cellmate named Bubba. :p Chris is rescued, and the two of you leave. 

HIDDEN CORRIDOR
-------------------

Don't move, just turn yourself around and enter the cell again.

CHRIS' PRISON CELL
----------------------

Aha! Been holding out on us? Grab the SHOTGUN SHELLS beside the bed. OK, 
now you're done here and can leave.

HIDDEN CORRIDOR
-------------------

Go around the corner and run up the stairs. Use the door.

PATIENT HALLWAY
-------------------

Follow Chris to the other end of the hall and use the double doors.

DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR
-----------------------

Take the double doors right beside you.

UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR
---------------------

Run up the staircase and flip around, running parallel to the stairs. 
Round the corner and use the door at the end.

LAB ENTRANCE
---------------

Heal yourself, stock up on supplies, and SAVE YOUR GAME. Don't save if 
you want to fight the first Tyrant again! Use the ladder beside you...

MACHINERY ROOM
------------------

Run forward, where you find Chris and Barry waiting for you. Use the 
huge metal door that's now open due to the self-destruct sequence.

MACHINERY HALLWAY
---------------------

Ignore the goodies laying on the floor -- some FIRST AID BOX and SHOTGUN 
SHELLS -- unless you can collect them while leaving ONE space open in 
your inventory. Run along the catwalk all the way to the end, where you 
should grab that small box thing, the FUSE UNIT. Head around the corner 
and check the alcove beside the elevator. Place in the Fuse Unit, 
restoring the power to the elevator and also triggering a cutscene. 
Tyrant is baaaaaack! Barry and Chris go to hold him off, while Jill 
makes her way up the elevator.

                      A timer of 3 minutes appears.

HELIPORT
------------

After you reach the top, grab that large gray case sitting on the 
ground, some SIGNAL ROCKETS. Immediately use them where you stand, and 
Jill will run to the center of the Helipad and shoot them off to signal 
Brad in the helicopter. Nearby the elevator comes back up, delivering 
Chris and Barry. Tyrant -- INCOMING!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                FINAL BOSS -- Tyrant, the FINAL battle!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This guy really isn't too difficult. Use Magnum rounds or Grenades to 
take him out. Just make sure you let Barry distract the Tyrant. With 
Tyrant's back to you, you can get off a full clip of Magnum rounds 
before he even notices. 

If Tyrant starts pacing slowly at you -- WATCH IT! He will soon run full 
speed and attempt to do a powerful bitch-slap attack which can instantly 
deliver you into DANGER health. Run perpendicular to him to dodge.

After doing enough damage to Tyrant, Brad will actually develop a set of 
balls and drop a ROCKET LAUNCHER down onto the helipad. Pick it up; this 
takes several seconds to grab, so plan accordingly. Now fire a rocket at 
Tyrant -- sometimes he blocks it and you need to shoot again, otherwise 
he'll be blown into little bits of confetti. You 1, Tyrant 0. 


GAME OVER.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Watch the ending (whichever one you got) and the credits. Now beat the 
game again -- but go faster! Maybe you can unlock more game modes or 
even some hidden weapons...

Ah, Chris Redfield -- how the game was meant to be played! After using 
him you'll never want to go back to Jill, at least that's how it was for 
me. Chris is great because his limited inventory of 6 spaces FORCES you 
to use less herbs, meaning you have to practice your Zombie-dodging. 
Which by the way, is much easier, since Chris runs twice as fast as Jill 
and has more stamina. And there's no sad Grenade Launcher in the game to 
hold your little hand! Oh by the way, due to the lack of space in Chris' 
inventory, I'll also be doing "Inventory Checks" along the way so you 
know exactly what you should have.

OPENING
-----------

After watching the GREAT cutscene with a forest and a pack of mutant 
guard-dogs, the remaining S.T.A.R.S. team members heed safety in an old, 
dilapidated mansion. This is where the "fun" begins...

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

There's three of you left: Jill, Wesker, and yourself, Chris Redfield. 
After a shot goes off, you head into the adjacent room to check it out.

DINING ROOM
---------------

Nothing much here, except grab the INK RIBBON sitting upon the table in 
front you, then save at the TYPEWRITER at your side. Head down the 
long table to fireplace. Take the door on the side.

KENNETH HALLWAY
-------------------

Head left, where we meet up with a Zombie having his midnight snack. 
Um...guess we caught him at a bad time? After gaining control turn 
yourself straight around and enter the Dining Room again.

DINING ROOM
--------------- 

Time to report back to Wesker! Head along the table and exit out the 
double doors. 

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Crap. Both Wesker and Jill are gone, just like Barry went missing a few 
minutes ago. Chris spots a HANDGUN laying on the floor. After you gain 
control, stand over it and pick it up. Immediately equip the weapon, as 
you'll be using it a LOT. Now take the double doors opposite from where 
you just came, on the right side. 

NOTE: If you take the double entrance doors, some Cerberus will be
      waiting on the porch for you, and Chris will get scared and
      quickly shut the door -- but not before a dog comes in after you.
      This is quite a nuisance if you have no Shotgun, and, you don't.   

STATUE ANTEROOM
------------------- 

Yes, that IS a sparkle you just saw in the vase part of the statue. Run 
past the statue, over to where a dresser is partly blocking a side 
passage. Push it right SLIGHTLY, so you can squeeze into the corridor, 
then turn around and push the dresser TOWARDS the statue. Climb up, and 
press A to get the glitter...the F1 MANSION MAP. 

Hop down from the dresser, then take the side corridor; we've got some 
old art supplies and things covered in tarp. At the end of the corridor, 
grab the DAGGER. Turn around, but when you go around the corner a Zombie 
"ambushes" you. God this is easy. Just get around it (even if you mess 
up, you just end up using the Dagger). Don't bother wasting the ammo 
killing the thing. Exit the corridor, then exit back to the Foyer.

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Dun dun dun. Most all of the doors are locked (except two). Head up the 
stairs, then take the double doors on the left side.

DINING BALCONY ROOM
-----------------------

Circle around left, and watch yourself, a Zombie is on the right. Push 
the statue forward, then off the ledge where the gap in the railing is. 
It'll hit the floor below and shatter. Circle around to the left side, 
avoiding the Zombie, and grab the DAGGER on the shelf. Exit to the foyer 
again. 

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Head downstairs and enter the Dining Room yet again. 

DINING ROOM
---------------

Remember that statue we pushed off the balcony upstairs? Well IGNORE it 
for right now! If you pick up the prize that was inside your inventory 
will be too full to get some specialty items up ahead. Exit to the 
hallway using the door by the fireplace.

KENNETH HALLWAY
-------------------

The Zombie's up and about, but to your right, and is moving about 1 
friggen MPH. Head left, and examine the dead body of your comrade, 
Kenneth (I named it "Kenneth Hallway" for a reason). You get a VCR tape 
file, but you can't view it yet. Exit out the end door.

FAR WEST STAIRS 
--------------------

Head around the darkened corner, and in the next chamber is a HANDGUN 
MAGAZINE sitting beside the bird cage...there's a dead raven in it, 
spooky. Ahem. Head up stairs and exit. 

YELLOW CORRIDOR
-------------------

Cross in front of the mirror beside you, and watch out, a Zombie is just 
around the corner. Dodge him and run down the hall with the spears. Grab 
that sparkle sitting on the statue, the GOLDEN ARROW. There's also a 
HANDGUN MAGAZINE resting on the floor beside the mirror. Exit out the 
door off to the right around the corner.

DINING BALCONY ROOM
-----------------------

Watch the Zombie, and exit out the double doors to the foyer again. 

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Head down the stairs, and right where the stairs branch in two different 
directions, there's a "hidden" (cough) door to exit out of.

GRAVEYARD
-------------

This area is where GameCube's lighting abilities come in handy, the fog 
really sets the mood and makes it look like more then just pre-renders. 
Head down the steps, turn the corner, head down some more steps, then 
follow the path straight to the end. Examine the Angel Statue, which 
suspiciously has an Arrowhead-shaped hole on it (duh, duh). On your 
status screen examine the Golden Arrow and Chris will find he can remove 
an ARROWHEAD, which you should then use on the statue to open a secret 
passage. Head down the stairs...

CRYPT
---------

A while later (Chris runs down much faster than Jill!), you'll be at the 
bottom, in a creepy crypt room complete with roaring furnaces, some 
gears, and a coffin suspicious suspended by chains. Run underneath the 
coffin (don't worry, it wouldn't open) and check the pedestal to get the 
BOOK OF CURSE. Examine the back of the book, and you'll find a Mansion 
Key lodged in its back cover. If you check the key itself, and you 
should see a sword symbol on the "handle" of it -- the SWORD KEY. Wooo. 
The Book of Curse is then filed away, and what it's talking about is 
those four face statues lining one of the Crypt walls...remember that 
later, when you have to come back here. Exit out of here.

GRAVEYARD

Enter the foyer again.


MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Trot down the stairs and take the double doors on the right again. 

STATUE ANTEROOM
-------------------

Run over to the door, and open it up using the Sword Key. 

KITCHEN CORRIDOR
--------------------

Run forward, and make sure not to freak out when the window PARTLY 
shatters. That scared me the first time. :p Push the first china cabinet 
forward to uncover a DAGGER. Head around the corner, then at the end 
push the last china cabinet away from the door to get a MUCH needed 
HANDGUN MAGAZINE. Exit through the door...

NOTE: If you backtrack through here •backwards•, some Cerberus will bust
      through the windows and attack. So this is a BAD IDEA. 

EAST WINDOW CORRIDOR
------------------------  

Head off to the left, and take that side door.

BATHROOM
------------

The bathtub's full of dirty water, so examine it, and pull the plug. A 
zombie pops out (gee surprise) and attacks Chris. Unlike Jill, Chris is 
a retard and just stands there gawking at the Zombie, giving it ample 
time to recover. Rather then wasting ammo killing the thing, quickly run 
over and examine the tub again for an OLD KEY. Now get outta here!

EAST WINDOW HALLWAY
-----------------------

Head left, and open that door in the corner using the Old Key you just 
got. Time for some fresh air...

SIDE GARDEN
---------------

There's more Cerberus, but they're safely outside the gates.

NOTE: If you come back here in the future, expect some Cerberus to be on
      you quickly. Plan accordingly by bringing a Shotgun.

Head around the corner, and grab the plastic bag in the wheelbarrow, 
some CHEMICAL. The last space in your inventory is filled. Once you 
examine it, it's renamed HERBICIDE, which should give you a hint on it's 
use (kills plant life). Head back inside.

EAST WINDOW CORRIDOR
------------------------

Run forward and head around the corner -- your friend from the Bathroom 
is BACK! Pass some windows, then go around another corner and enter the 
double doors at the end.

EAST HALLWAY
----------------

Take the first side door on your left by the chair...

BOTTOM OF EAST STAIRS
-------------------------

Head along the hallway, but immediately off to your right is a Zombie. 
Take the door you find here at the bottom of the stairs.

EAST STAIRS STORAGE ROOM
----------------------------

Ah, safety. This room is completely safe, and has a ITEM BOX and a 
TYPEWRITER for you. Grab the FUEL CANTEEN sitting right of the Item Box, 
then the "Body Disposal" file on the floor in front of the box. Read 
that file, know it, love it.  

Run over to the Typewriter, and beside it you should notice a plastic, 
white tank. This is a KEROSENE TANK, which you should use to fill the 
Fuel Canteen you just picked up. This fuel, used with a Lighter (Chris 
already has it in his inventory) allows you to burn Zombie bodies so  
they don't come back to life as Crimson Heads. But Chris' paltry 
inventory space makes burning any Zombies not economically feasible. 
Grab the OLD KEY sitting in front of the Typewriter. Save your game, 
then deposit any superficial items and exit the room.

BOTTOM OF EAST STAIRS

Head up the stairs to the top...

EAST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

Off to your right a Zombie will greet you, so get around him, then run 
past and exit the door at the end (the other door has no doorknob).


DILAPIDATED BROWN HALLWAY
-----------------------------

Head left, and enter the door at the end.

STUDY
---------

Directly beside you, collect the DOG WHISTLE sitting on the dresser. You 
also get a "crumpled memo" which reveals what you should do with it -- 
summon a dog who hangs around the west, second floor balcony; apparently 
he's got something special hidden in his collar. Beside the chess board 
is a HANDGUN MAGAZINE. Head to the next section in the room, and pick up 
the purple "Book of Botany" (file). Exit out the other door. 

EAST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

Be careful of the Zombie and take the door to your right at the end of 
the hall a second time.

DILAPIDATED BROWN HALLWAY
-----------------------------

All the other doors are locked, so just turn right and run all the way 
to the door at the end, where you head through using your Sword Key.  

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Run forward, then head down the stairs. At the bottom use the double 
doors off to the left.

DINING ROOM
---------------

Alright, remember a ways back when we pushed that statue off the ledge 
from the room above? Well run to the debris of the statue over near the 
fireplace and grab the sparkle there -- a BLUE GEMSTONE. We'll use this 
later. Take the side door by the table...

KENNETH HALLWAY
-------------------

Head right, where the Zombie is waiting. To get past him you should pop 
him in the legs a few times; just enough to drop him to the floor. Keep 
going down the hall, then go around where the elevator is and run down 
the stairs. Use the door at the bottom.

KITCHEN
-----------

Trot farther in the room and should notice that sparkle on the shelf by 
the glass door. Go over and grab it...another OLD KEY. Grab the DAGGER 
sitting on the wooden table above where that dead guy is laying on the 
floor. Exit out the door you came in. We have a nice little cutscene of 
a Zombie (what else?) coming down that stairs and confronting you in the 
kitchen. Could this get any friggen easier? Dodge the thing and leave.

KENNETH HALLWAY
-------------------

Head up the stairs, and take the door on the left that leads back to the 
Dining Room.

Head around the left side (the Zombie is on the left side now!) and open 
up the second side door using your Sword Key. Discard the key and exit 
through the door. 

WEST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

Turn to you right and open up that first gray door using one of your Old 
Keys. However do NOT go through! Head around the corner, then run along 
the edge of the stairs. Run down the stairs (watch the ZOMBIE). 

BOTTOM OF WEST STAIRS
-------------------------

Enter the door off to the side.

DRUG ROOM
-------------

Drugs as in medicines...cough. ;) This room is just like the other "save 
room" on the opposite side of the mansion, complete with TYPEWRITER and 
ITEM BOX. Definitely SAVE your game. Before you leave, get rid of your 
Blue Gemstone and Ink Ribbon. Exit out of here...

BOTTOM OF WEST STAIRS
-------------------------

Head around the corner, then down the hall with the windows. At the end, 
open the side door using your last Old Key. Head through. 

FURNITURE STORAGE CLOSET
----------------------------

We've got a KEROSENE TANK here...but grab the INK RIBBON in the desk 
drawer beside the tank, and the FLASH GRENADE on the edge of the other 
dresser. Also grab the BROKEN SHOTGUN out of that glass case. Exit from 
the room.

BOTTOM OF WEST STAIRS
-------------------------

Backtrack right, and head around the corner with the pillar again. Keep 
going then trot up the stairs.

WEST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

Back around the perimeter of the stairs again. Round the corner and exit 
out the end door.

DINING BALCONY ROOM
-----------------------

Dodge the Zombie and use the double doors at the other end of the room.

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Run down the stairs. At the bottom use the double doors to the right.

STATUE ANTEROOM
-------------------

Head to the other side and use the door.

KITCHEN CORRIDOR
--------------------

Follow this all the way to the end and use the other door.

EAST WINDOW CORRIDOR
------------------------

Run left and go around the corner -- WATCH the Zombie. Pass in front of 
the windows then round another corner, taking that single side door.

QUAINT LITTLE ROOM
----------------------

Cross over and enter the next room.

ANTIQUE ANTEROOM
--------------------

If you examine the coffee table, you'll find a DAGGER on one end and 
some precious INK RIBBON on the other. At the back wall, grab the 
SHOTGUN sitting on the two hooks...which looks like they trigger a 
switch. ;) Now use your Broken Shotgun and place it on the hooks. Exit 
out of this room.

QUAINT LITTLE ROOM
----------------------

NOTE: If you hadn't placed the Broken Shotgun on those hooks, the
      ceiling would be trying to crush you right about now... 

Exit out the other door.

Run forward down the hall, dodge the Zombie, then run up the stairs.

EAST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

Head right and go around the corner, dodging the Zombie and taking the 
door at the end.

DILAPIDATED BROWN HALLWAY
-----------------------------

Follow this hall all the way to the end and use the door you find.

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Head to the opposite side of the foyer and use the double doors.

DINING BALCONY ROOM
-----------------------

Head around and be careful of the Zombie! Take the second side door.

WEST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

Turn to you right and open up the first gray door (should have unlocked 
it earlier with one of your Old Keys). 

OUTSIDE TERRACE BALCONY
---------------------------

OK, prepare yourself for some heavier fighting. Use the GREEN HERB 
TERRACE on that side area if you need health. Remember that terrace, and 
don't waste it later in the game healing on stupid things. Head along 
the balcony edge until you reach the area where the balcony widens. Trot 
down the stairs and get in the wide area, right beside that circular 
planter at the base of the steps. Make sure you have your Shotgun 
equipped, and you're facing the left (direction you just came from). 
Blow your Dog Whistle. 

Seems Lassie and his little friend have come for a visit! Blow them away 
with your Shotgun (sey h'llo t'my lil' friend!) and collect the COLLAR 
from the one dog. Examine the Collar on your status screen -- look at 
the buckle -- and you'll find a switch. Push it and out pops a COIN. 
Sure looks suspicious...examine the back of it to find an armor 
insignia, and transform the Coin into IMITATION OF A KEY.    

Continue along the balcony, going to the other end and unlocking the 
door. DON'T go out it. Head back to the other end of the balcony and 
exit out the door you came from. Yeah, you can discard the whistle! 

WEST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

Head to the right and go around the perimeter of the stairs. Head down 
that hall and use the door at the end (you unlock it). Exit out.

YELLOW CORRIDOR
-------------------

Trot through the gap with the mirror corner. Head right, going down that 
hallway piece and exit out the door (Crimson Head will appear from that 
body, scary).  

KNIGHTS' HALLWAY
--------------------

Head up the stairs. This cramped hallway has three •suspicious• Knight 
statues along it, all with inscriptions relating to death. Find the 
pedestal with the key in it and inspect it. 

"May whoever takes this emblem find peace in death."

Take the Mansion Key...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               KEY PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

First "real" puzzle of the game, and it's easy, to say the least. After 
taking out the key from the pedestal, place in your Imitation of a Key. 
The whirling-blade knight will retreat and the surroundings will return 
to normal. Wow...that was hard...wait, no.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examine the Mansion Key -- the ARMOR KEY! The door at the other end is 
locked, so turn straight around, and head down the stairs. Exit out the 
door at the bottom.

YELLOW CORRIDOR
-------------------

We have to deal with that Crimson Head that appeared a few minutes ago 
(or at least dodge it). Run down this hall piece to where the gap is. 
Brace yourself...duck through the gap and as fast as you can exit out 
that first door there. Most of the time the Crimson wouldn't even get 
yah once...

WEST STAIRS HALLWAY
-----------------------

Run down this hall piece then trot down the stairs.

BOTTOM OF WEST STAIRS
-------------------------

Take the door of to the side...

DRUG ROOM
-------------

Definitely SAVE YOUR GAME, but also make sure your inventory looks like 
the check below. Exit the room...

LONG WINDOW HALLWAY
-----------------------

Grab the FLASH GRENADE sitting on the desk beside you...yah, that's the 
shadow of a Zombie knocking at the window, but you're safe from it for 
now. Head right, going down the hall, then turn left and enter that tiny 
side hall. Go through the door...

TIGER ALTAR ROOM
--------------------

Tiger Statue with a suspicious inscription. Guess you could say it's 
suspicious. :p

Use the Blue Gemstone, and Chris will place it in the statue's right 
eye, causing it to turn and reveal some SHOTGUN SHELLS. Just what we 
needed! Grab them then leave.

LONG WINDOW HALLWAY
----------------------- 

Head across the hall and exit through that door.

KEEPER'S ROOM
-----------------

What happened here?! Grab the HANDGUN MAGAZINE on the bed, and head 
around...did that closet door just move? Anyway, go to the desk and read 
the HILARIOUS file of the "Keeper's Diary." Brace yourself -- turn 
around and go check the closet doors...causing them to fling open, 
revealing a Zombie. Use what little space you have to maneuver around 
him, then grab the OLD KEY in the closet. Get around the bed -- WATCH 
OUT -- that other Zombie came alive as well. Get outta here...

LONG WINDOW HALLWAY
----------------------- 

Turn right, and head down the hall, round the corner and pass the 
windows, then enter the door at the end.

NURSERY
-----------

We have a bunch of plants here, of course, and a water pump in the 
corner beside where you enter. If you head forward a little, you can see 
a giant "vine-ish" plant that engulfs a fountain. If you go around the 
first planter you'll get whipped by one of his vines, so be careful. 
Head to the water pump, and use your Herbicide...Chris places the bag in 
the water. Now examine the pump and say "yes" you want to pump the 
water. PUMP TO THE RED SIDE. 

The fountain will turn on, spurting out a colorful red water and kill 
off the vines (don't freak out when they suddenly jerk upwards). The 
threats over, so head to the other side of the Nursery -- we have some 
Green Herbs on some planks, but more importantly, grab the DEATH MASK 
sitting on the shield. Examine it to get MASK W/OUT EYES. Exit out. 

NOTE: If you pump to the •green• side, the Herbicide-laced water will be
      sprayed on the pots of Green Herbs and wither/KILL them, rendering
      the things useless.

SECOND NOTE: It's rather obvious where the water leads. Just check the
             red and green pipe lines leading from the pump -- one
             clearly goes left and the other to the right. 

LONG WINDOW HALLWAY
-----------------------

The Zombie is not at the window...run forward...SHATTER. Keep running 
and dodge the Zombies as they fly out of the windows (must be Jackie 
Chan Adventures; they take some time to get up). Turn right, and run 
down the hall to the end, unlocking the door and heading through. 

KENNETH HALLWAY
-------------------

We basically went in a circle. Head down the hall here (going towards 
the Zombie) and unlock the next side door with your Armor Key. 
Backtrack, and take the other side door beside you to the Dining Room.

DINING ROOM
---------------

Exit to the foyer again...

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Now, we're going to finish up unlocking doors with the Armor Key; 
there's four left in total. Head up the stairs, and at the top, head to 
the right side (side with two single doors). Unlock the door in the far 
corner with your Armor Key. Enter through the door.

GARDEN BALCONY
------------------

We have a little glass greenhouse going on here, so exit out, and pass 
the glass table. Head around the corner, there's some more plants, and, 
the DEAD BODY of your S.T.A.R.S. teammate Forest. Sorry, no Grenade 
Launcher for Chris Redfield! Before leaving, grab the DAGGER sitting on 
the side of the brown bench. You DO NOT want to go around the last 
corner as Forest will come alive and ambush you...besides there's just 
some semi-useful Green Herb. Exit out of this area...

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Take the single door just beside you.

DILAPIDATED BROWN HALLWAY
-----------------------------

Unlock the door just ahead of you with your Armor Key. Head around the 
corner, then unlock metal double doors. Keep going, then take the first 
side door to the stairs.

Run forward, go around the corner, then head down and open the side door 
with your Armor Key. One left to go! Head down the stairs.

BOTTOM OF EAST STAIRS

Sitting on the wall by the stairs is a brown note:

"I left some bullets in the room on your right. I'll go ahead and look 
for a way out.   -Wesker-"

Enter the save room....   

EAST STAIRS STORAGE ROOM
----------------------------

Ah sweet ammo! Take all the clips and goodies and put them away in the

PORTRAIT GALLERY
-------------------

OK, we have another puzzle here, and this one is actually •puzzling•. 
Without my help, you might actually have to try it two, maybe even three 
times. ;)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             PORTRAIT PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Along this hallway are six portraits, and at the end is a portrait of 
Lisa, whom is guarded by the "three spirits." If you notice carefully in 
the picture, Lisa is wearing a GREEN CROWN, PURPLE NECKLACE, and ORANGE 
BRACELET.

The six portraits along the hall consist of: 

• 2 Valiants, which wear bracelets 
• 2 Sages, which wear necklaces
• 2 Saints, which wear crowns

Each picture has a switch on it, which can be used to light a certain 
color. You need to light a Valiant orange, a Sage purple, and a Saint 
green. Keep the rest of the lights off. Easy, no?

If you mess up at any time, the crows perched on the rails will let you 
know...hoho. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Press the switch on the Lisa portrait and head outside, grabbing the 
DEATH MASK. Examine it, it's the MASK W/OUT MOUTH. Use your Old Key on 
the gate beside you. Exit out.

GRAVEYARD
-------------

Head up the stairs, entering into the Mansion Foyer again.

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Head up the stairs to the RIGHT. Take the first side door.

DILAPIDATED BROWN HALLWAY
-----------------------------

Head forward and take the first door on the right.

RICHARD HALLWAY
-------------------

A cutscene automatically starts playing; you're greeted by nurse Rebecca 
Chambers treating a fellow S.T.A.R.S. member, Richard Aikens. He's been 
bitten by a snake and unfortunately, it was poisonous. Chris agrees to 
go get Rebecca some Serum to help treat the wounds (yea! cough...). 
After the cutscene Chris exits back into the hallway. We're officially 
the errand boy for the time being! Make it over to the Drug Room in the 
west side of the mansion (hey, it's on you're map, and it's just the 
save room at the bottom of the stairs, besides, you even get that nice 
color photo). And don't THINK I'm writing room by room to walk you over 
there. Lazy.

DRUG ROOM
------------- 

Once here, check that medicine cabinet beside the Item Box to get the 
SERUM. Also deposit the masks away. Leave here, then head back to 
Richard. Seconds count!

RICHARD HALLWAY
------------------

Run in and Chris will hand over the stuff to Rebecca...she treats the 
wounds, then gets the bright idea to carry Richard back to the Drug 
Room. Oh the tedium!

DRUG ROOM
-------------

Richard's safely in bed, and after Chris leaves the room, if you come 
back in and talk to Rebecca you can get her to FULLY HEAL your wounds. 
Talk 'bout a deal! Also make sure your inventory is like below, then 
head back to the Richard hallway.

ATTIC HALLWAY
-----------------

Turn left, and watch yourself for the Zombie that is waiting for you. 
You can actually get around him without firing a single shot if you wait 
for him to hobble to where the halls intersect. Do whatever, and enter 
the door at the end of the hall.

ATTIC DINING ROOM
---------------------

Collect the HANDGUN MAGAZINE setting on the edge of the table, then trot 
around it, and use your Lighter to set ablaze the candlestick on the 
table corner. If you dodged your friend in the hall, he should come 
barreling in, so fill him full of lead then check the cabinet in the 
left corner for another HANDGUN MAGAZINE. Over on the other wall, you 
should notice that suspicious green cabinet -- push it to the right, and 
reveal a secret room. A ZOMBIE is waiting inside, so take it down. Check 
the bookcase and rechieve the MUSICAL SCORE. Exit out of the room. 

ATTIC HALLWAY
-----------------

Exit out the door you came in.

RICHARD HALLWAY
-------------------

Round the corner and exit out.

DILAPIDATED BROWN HALLWAY

KNIGHT ARMORY
-----------------

Immediately when you enter, four Knight statues move forward. Puzzle!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              KNIGHT PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, I was reading CVXFREAK's guide, and I have to say his solution is 
whacked up. You can solve this puzzle in just three moves. THREE of'em.


1# -- Move the FAR RIGHT statue back into place. 

2# -- Move the CLOSE LEFT statue back into place.

3# -- Move the CLOSE RIGHT statue back into place.


And the final statue automatically moves into place. This puzzle is made 
even easier with the fact the four knights each are holding a different 
weapon, and if you look at the back wall you see four portraits with the 
different knights. :p 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check the pedestal in the center of the knights, then flick the switch, 
which opens up a depression in the back wall. Go check it, and rechieve 
the JEWELRY BOX. 

Examine the Jewelry Box on your status screen, and if you check the lid 
it mentions a hint about "sunlight." The sun icon clearly has two shapes 
in it, a small tear-drop shape and large one. Press the switch on the 
front side, and on the back side (which have the same shapes). The 
center of the sun icon with light up, allowing the box to open and 
giving you a third DEATH MASK. Examine the mask -- it's MASK W/OUT ALL. 
Exit out this room. 

DILAPIDATED BROWN HALLWAY

DEER HEAD GALLERY

Errrr...no comment. The door on the left is locked, so you should 
obviously take the right (pun) door.

UPSTAIRS BEDROOM
--------------------

Take no heed of the camera view, there's NO monster under the desk. Grab 
the FIRST AID BOX sitting on the chair, and examine it's lid to get a
FIRST AID SPRAY. Check the center desk for your last OLD KEY, then check 
the desk in the corner for some INK RIBBON. Leave the room.

NOTE: Around the bed is some outta-sight Green Herb. 


DEER HEAD GALLERY
---------------------

Head to the opposite side, unlocking it with your Old Key. Exit through.

SPECIMEN LAB
---------------- 

First things first...grab the white "Researcher's Will" file sitting on 
the table across from the fishtank. Now...

• Check the hook box on the wall by the fish tank, and get the FISHHOOK.

• Head to the insect box by the bookcase, and get the LURE OF A BEE.


• Head to the lure box by the door, and pick up the BEE SPECIMEN.

Combine the Fishhook and Lure of a bee on the status screen. Seems the 
lure and specimen were reversed in the boxes...hint, hint...put the lure 
in the lure box, and the insect in the insect box. Press the switch, and 
you uncover a hidden alcove! After the bee comes alive, shoot it a few 
times with your Handgun to get rid of it.

NOTE: If you walk exactly right, you can squish the bee's body on the
      floor. Sweet sweet revenge...and it makes a beautiful "squish"
      sound and a large green puddle.

Grab the WIND CREST then leave this creepy room...

Take the center door to the hall...

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Travel down stairs, taking the double doors on the left.

DINING ROOM
---------------

Run along the table, then examine the fireplace at the end. Take the 
EMBLEM from the wall. Use the door to your side...

KENNETH HALLWAY
-------------------

The first door on your left •may• be shaking if a Zombie is pounding at 
it. Head right, and go down the hall. Take the second door on the right.

BAR AND LOUNGE
------------------

Run around the grand piano and then take the little passage. Push the 
bookcase to the right, revealing a shelf where you can pick up another 
MUSICAL SCORE. Combine the two scores on your status screen to get the 
complete MOONLIGHT SONATA. Now trot on over to the piano and use the 
Sonata -- Chris will "play" the song...HORRIBLY. Luckily Rebecca comes 
in and takes over, playing the song again; except her interpretation is 
off a bit. Say "yes" to let Rebecca practice.

The fastest way to get her all practiced-up is to TRIGGER A CUTSCENE. 
How to do that you ask? Simple. Head back over to the Drug Room and 
examine Richard laying on the bed...a scene will play showing Chris 
sitting next to him keeping Richard company. Tadah! Now come back to 
this room and Rebecca will summon you over, playing the song flawlessly. 
Nearby, a hidden panel retracts.

Travel inside the passage grabbing the GOLD EMBLEM on the wall 
piece...the door retracts behind you. Gee, I wonder what we do next? 
Place the Emblem in the Gold Emblem's place to open it up again. Grab 
Trevor's Diary at your feet before leaving...

KENNETH HALLWAY
-------------------

Head down and exit to the Dining Room again.

DINING ROOM
---------------

Place the Gold Emblem in the blank spot over the fireplace...nearby, the 
door on the clock opens revealing it's gears. Head over, and inspect the 
clock. I think it's puzzle time! Cha-ching.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              CLOCK PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This puzzle is extremely easy if you observe a few clues. But first, 
remember that:

• small gear moves the LONG hand
• large gear moves the SHORT hand
• both hands are pointing straight up, AKA, it's midnight

As you inspect the clock, you read the inscription -- "When the two have 
run each other through, the path to your destiny will open." 

Now, if you check the painting by the clock, it says -- "A picture of 
two knights striking each other. The short sword has been thrust into 
the breast of one knight, while the long sword has pierced the head of 
the other."

This should make the puzzle just TOO EASY. Just turn the short hand 
(large gear) twice to the RIGHT. Bing, bang, bong, we have the long hand 
pointing at the HELMET, and the short hand pointing at the ARMOR.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grab the MANSION KEY from the alcove that is revealed, and inspect it -- 
the SHIELD KEY. This key is actually pretty useless, as it opens up only 
one door. Exit out the double doors.

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Head up the stairs, then take the first door on the RIGHT, which leads 
to the crappy (pun) looking brown hallway.

DILAPIDATED BROWN HALLWAY

Take the door on the right...

RICHARD HALLWAY
-------------------

Round the corner then exit out the door.

ATTIC HALLWAY
-----------------

Run forward and trot up the stairs. Open the cobweb-infested door with 
your Shield Key, then discard it...enter. *cue music*

ATTIC
---------

Hmmm...quiet, too quiet. Head down the room -- out of no where a GIANT 
Python pops out of the rafter. I swear, that scared the LIVING CRAP out 
of me the first time! :p Time, for a boss fight.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         BOSS -- Yawn the Python
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This guy is such a pain. He'll sling around and try to trap you in a 
little space with his body, and then when he rears up, prepare for a 
bite -- which not only damages you, but POISONS as well. Where's that 
Blue Herb when we need it? Well, due to lack of a Grenade Launcher and 
the scarcity of Shotgun shells, Chris Redfield should NOT EVEN FIGHT 
THIS BATTLE. Just ignore the snake the whole time...

And oh for GOD'S SAKES don't let Yawn bite you...if you do, Chris ends 
up getting poisoned. This means when you step out into the hall again, 
the poison in Chris' bloodstream will cause him to fall to the floor. 
Then Rebecca comes along, and you have to PLAY AS HER and head over to 
the Drug Room, grab a Serum, then come back...a TOTAL waste of time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

While avoiding the snake, head to the upper left hand corner of the room 
and grab the fourth and final DEATH MASK sitting on the wooden crate. 
This one's MASK W/OUT NOSE. Since we have all four Death Masks, we can 
use them in the Graveyard. You remember those four statues in the Crypt, 
right? Exit out of here...

ATTIC HALLWAY
-----------------

Run straight ahead and use the door.

RICHARD HALLWAY
-------------------

A Zombie will be waiting for you, so get around him then exit the other 
door. You should head to the Drug Room save area so you can get ALL four 
of the Death Masks, also save your game...head to the foyer when you're 
through.

GRAVEYARD
-------------

Run down both sets of stairs, then travel forward and descend the stairs 
to the Crypt.

CRYPT
---------

See the four statues lining the wall? Place the four Death Masks on each 
appropriate statue -- everytime a mask is place, the nearby suspended 
coffin is disturbed...and what the nut is that blood from?! After all 
four masks are placed, the coffin falls and flies open...head over to 
inspect it. A gate shuts blocking the entrance and out pops an ol' 
Crimson Head.

Ah crap.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        BOSS -- Mega Crimson Head
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're prepared, this guy is pretty easy...but do expect a •HARDER• 
battle then when you were playing as Jill Valentine. Have your Shotgun 
equipped and try to play a game of "toro" with the Mega Crimson Head. 
Fire off a shell, then wait for him to charge at you; dodge as he tries 
to claw you, then fire another shell. And TRY TO RELOAD your Shotgun on 
your status screen BEFORE your character has to reload during game play. 
Wouldn't want to be caught with your pants down...so to speak.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grab the item beside the coffin -- some SHOTGUN SHELLS -- then check the 
coffin. Chris will flip a switch opening the entrance along with finding 
a STONE & METAL OBJECT. Basically, an octagonal-edged disk with the 
Umbrella insignia. Leave the Crypt, backtracking up the stairs.

GRAVEYARD

Run along the path, but at the end take the side gate.

Clever shortcut, no? Run forward but watch that friggen Zombie. Get

Arm yourself with a Shotgun, then tread lightly down the path. Blow to

end, examine that "shelf" depression. "To the defiler of the accursed 
coffin." Place in the Stone & Metal Object, which unlocks the adjacent 
door...head through.

GARDEN SUPPLY SHED
----------------------

There's a FIRST AID SPRAY and FLASH GRENADE on the shelf over the 
stairs, and some SHOTGUN SHELLS in the shed corner. There's two ways to 
get to the Courtyard (area two), but we want to exit out the door at the 
bottom of the stairs...

DESOLATE SIDE PATH 
----------------------

It may be a bit uneasy to step out side, but there's no enemies in this 
section. Trot down the steps then turn right, following the path till 
you come to a nearby signpost...we've got another puzzle here. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             CERBERUS PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sign reads: 

North: Valley of Destruction
South: Cave of Hatred
East:  Summit of Madness
West:  Path of Revenge

Keep those locations in mind. Follow the winding path all the way to the 
end, where you come to two Cerberus statues and a locked gate. The gate 
reads -- "The gates will open when the guard dog's desires are 
fulfilled." Now check both statues...

LEFT STATUE   -- "The Last Gasps of Destruction" 
RIGHT STATUE  -- "The War Cry of Revenge"

Back a ways you should have passed two weathervanes -- the blue one goes 
to the left statue, and the red to the right. Turn the blue one to the 
NORTH, and the red one to the WEST. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ta-dah, the gate unlocks! Pass on through... 

FOREST GRAVEYARD
--------------------

Absolutely nothing to do here yet, unless you like watching some Crows. 
Follow the path straight and take the opposite gate.

PATH THROUGH THE WOODS
--------------------------

What was that strange noise? Cough. ;) Another no-brainer here -- follow 
the trail to the end, where you find a Cabin at the top of the hill. 
Enter the front door.

CABIN
---------

Head around the corner, then another one. Everything is covered in 
cobwebs and there's a bunch of junk laying around, but strangely, the 
fireplace is lit...hmmm. Trot up the staircase then grab the COURTYARD 
MAP on the wall. Enter the next room, where we have a bed, but more 
importantly a TYPEWRITER. Examine the area of the table where the lamp 
is -- we get a STRANGE file that's in barely decipherable English. 

Head to the next area, which is a hallway with an ITEM BOX. Take out 
some Ink Ribbon if you need to and go save your game, then come back 
here and deposit the ribbon away. Trot to the right, hop down to the 
lower area, and grab the CRANK sitting on the board at the end. Examine 
the tip of it; it's renamed SQUARE CRANK. 

Climb back up and deposit any junk in the Item Box...

doorway. THUNK! Chris is knocked unconscious by a pair of arms, but he 
awakens in time to have an encounter with Lisa (the monster in chains)!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          BOSS -- Lisa Trevor 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now we know what that sound was at the beginning of the Path Through the 
Woods! DO NOT fight this thing (as it's invincible) just get out the 
HELL of here. Due to Chris' greater stamina, even when Lisa hits you 
it's not too much to worry about. Leave the Cabin when you get to the 
door.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

PATH THROUGH THE WOODS
--------------------------

Backtrack all the way to the bottom of the hill, though you will 
encounter a (as in ONE) Zombie along the way...hardly exciting.

FOREST GRAVEYARD
-------------------- 

The Crows make this part so friggen ANNOYING. Run forward and up the 
trail between the gravestones, causing the Crows (99% of the time) to be 
disturbed and start chasing you. Puzz-ah time! 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             CREST PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examine the right tombstone to uncover a suspicious indentation...place 
your Wind Crest in it, which causes a panel to flip over revealing three 
more crests. 

• Check the tombstone three more times, picking up the MOON CREST, STAR
  CREST, and SUN CREST. 

• Examine the back of each crest on your status screen and press the
  buttons you find, causing styles of iron bars to pop out.  

• Place the crests in the opposite tombstone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your prized is revealed -- a coveted MAGNUM REVOLVER. An EXTREMELY 
powerful gun, but slow firing (and the ammo is scarce), so use it ONLY 
on bosses. Now take the other gate out of here before you get mauled to 
death by the Crows. Woo boy. 

DESOLATE SIDE PATH
----------------------

Backtrack to the beginning and use the door. Once in the Garden Supply 
Shed, take the wooden double doors.

PILLAR COURTYARD
--------------------

Run forward a few steps and Brad will contact you on your radio. After a 
totally pointless cutscene, you can here a strange "pacing" sound ahead. 
This is coming from a GROUP of Cerberus in the next little area...there 
are two ways to tackle this problem.

Man's Way -- Arm yourself with a Shotgun (Assault, preferably) and
             bust on in there, firing off shots at POINT-BLANK range
             at the dogs. Use the pillars to shield you, too. 

Coward's Way -- HUG the right wall as you run, to keep from being
                mauled...

I prefer the first way, as not only do you free yourself from danger, 
but you also get access to a some herb. Plus, it boosts your ego. :p 
Either way, exit out the gate at the top of the stairs.

STORAGE POOL
----------------

I have no idea why they would have this pond, maybe for the Mansion's 
plumbing system, but I sure wouldn't be drinking that water. Run around 
the left side of the pool, where at the end you find a pillar with a 
square-shaped hole (ahem). Use your Square Crank on it, causing some 
gates below to open and drain the pool. Cha-ching! Head back around and 
use the ladder, running along the brick path at the bottom and taking 
the other ladder. Follow this path to end where an old-style Lift is 
waiting for you...

WATERFALL COURTYARD
----------------------- 
  
More Crows, arg. Run forward, going around the waterfall and use the 
other gate (nothing to see here yet). 

BRICK CORRIDOR
------------------

Follow the Corridor all the way to the end and use the door. RUN the 
whole time, to avoid Snakes that drop from above.

Ahhhhh, Giant Spider on the roof (avoid these things entirely). Quickly, 
run right and go round the corner. Run down the first set of stairs. At 
the bottom, grab the SHOTGUN SHELLS on the first table, then the RED 
BOOK and FIRST AID BOX on the bar. Examine the box to get MIXED HERBS -- 
one green, one blue. Now exit completely out of this room (watch that 
spider on the way out). 

FRONT HALLWAY
-----------------

Run forward, where you'll spot a crate in the hall, and a nearby 
corridor littered with holes in the floor. If you just run over the 
holes, expect to be strangled for a few seconds by a giant vine that 
pops up. It's only slightly damaging, but VERY annoying. To get around 
this, take the crate and push it like the diagram shows below. I added 
the diagram because the other guides are poorly written on this fact! 
  
   (BEFORE)               (AFTER)

use the door at the end! 

INNER HALLWAY
-----------------

Run down the hallway and go around the corner, taking the second door 
with the "002" on top of it.

ROOM 002
------------

Take the door on your right side. It's actually quite hard to see, and 
in my first game I couldn't find it for awhile! Doh. 

002 BATHROOM
----------------

Toilet's busted...lovely, trotting over a fecal covered floor. Not 
what I had in mind. Grab the shiny object on the shelf by the toilet; 
it's a RESIDENCE KEY, and if you examine it on the status screen it's 
renamed -- KEY FOR ROOM 001. Yes, that's the door rattling, and after 
the Zombie pops it kill the dang thing then leave.

ROOM 002
------------
 
Run forward and check the desk at your left for a "Plant 42 Report." 
Read that, it has very useful information. Head to the two identical 
bookcases at the end of the room...push the left one back against the 
wall, then push the right bookcase to the right. You uncover a ladder, 
but don't go down it yet, instead exit this room going back to the 
hallway. 

INNER HALLWAY
-----------------

Round the corner and backtrack down the hallway to the door at the end.

FRONT HALLWAY
-----------------

Climb over the tops of the crates, then take the door off to your left, 
unlocking it with the Key for Room 001. Discard the key and enter. 

ROOM 001
------------

Some guy's foot is at the corner of the screen, he's hanging from the 
rafters, so no, he wouldn't attack. Run down the hall piece and in the 
next bedroom area grab the HANDGUN MAGAZINE on the desk. Beside that, 
grab the SELF DEFENSE GUN -- you also get a "Suicide Note." The gun 
fires a single bullet that should stop a Zombie dead in its tracks. Grab 
the other HANDGUN MAGAZINE on the rocking chair then exit through the 
side door...

001 BATHROOM
----------------

Drain the bathtub and grab the CONTROL ROOM KEY you find in the bottom. 
SNAP -- outside a rope breaks and should be PRETTY obvious where it came 
from. The dead guy by the bathtub also comes alive, so get out of here, 
NOW, don't bother wasting ammo.

ROOM 001
------------

Exit back into the hallway.

FRONT HALLWAY
-----------------

Take the door off to your side again...

RESIDENTIAL STORAGE
-----------------------

Deposit everything away...you just need to see below. Also make sure to 
SAVE YOUR GAME (and redeposit the Ink Ribbon away)! Exit out.

INNER HALLWAY
-----------------

Follow it to the end, then enter Room 002.

ROOM 002
------------ 

Use the ladder in the back by the bookcases.

AQUA RING -- ACCESS TUNNEL A664-1
-------------------------------------

Follow this tunnel to the end, where you find three wooden crates and a 
pool of water you can't pass.

• Push the crate closest to the water straight ahead, into the pool.
• Push the second closest crate into the pool.
• Push the farthest crate around the corner, then into the pool.

Run across the bridge created, and DEFINITELY, grab that GREEN HERB in 
the corner. Wade through the water and open the metal double doors.

AQUA RING -- SHARK ENCLOSURE
--------------------------------

As Chris steps in, he sees Richard nearby clinging to a metal 
outcropping...as soon as Chris tries to walk over to him, Neptune the 
shark pops up and eats Richard. The bastard! If you stick around here 
you'll be shark-food for sure! 

NOTE: Due to the waist-high water, your running is slowed considerably. 

MOVE YOUR CHRIS REDFIELD ASS! Run along the catwalk to the left till you 
come across a small bridge. Cross it, then head left along the inner 
catwalk. Trot up the stairs when you reach them, and unlock the door 
with the Control Room Key. Discard the key and enter inside QUICKLY. 

SECOND NOTE: If you hang around you might actually see Neptune again --
             she can swallow you in ONE BITE! Not to mention scare the
             crap out of you...

AQUA RING -- CONTROL ROOM
-----------------------------

You can use the herb you got in the Access Tunnel if you got bit by a 
shark (and you most likely did). The red lamp to your right indicates an 
emergency has occurred. Head down the ladder.

At the bottom here, check the spotted document on the table to your 
left. It'll say which valve to release in case of a drop in OIL 
PRESSURE. Keep this number in mind! Collect the AQUA RING MAP on the 
back wall, then head back to the ladder. Our goal now is to drain the 
water in the Shark Enclosure... 

• Head to the side window, and examine the console...say "yes" to
  draining the water. A malfunction occurs, and one of those bastard
  sharks headbutts the window, causing a critical loss of pressure in
  the room.

NOTE: When the critical gauge comes on, your difficulty (easy/normal)
      depends on how fast it fills up.

• Run to the console with the black chair in front of it. Examine, then
  release the safety.
 
• Run to the console in front of the main window. Choose to lower the
  Pressure Doors. Another malfunction -- the doors stop midway. We need
  to restore the oil pressure before continuing. 

• Head out to the hallway and check the tanks just to your right. Choose
  the correct valve (1,2,3...whatever was on the document) and turn it 
  back on.

• Head back into the room, examine the console with the chair, and
  release the safety a second time.

• Examine the console in front of the main windows, and lower the
  Pressure Doors. The emergency is OVER!

Now just lower the water in the Shark Enclosure using the console in 
front of the side window. Head into the hall, grabbing the FIRST AID BOX 
by the tanks. Examine it to get MIXED HERBS, of two Green Herbs. Run 
down the hall, and use the door at the end.

AQUA RING -- STORAGE CHAMBER
--------------------------------

Everything is soaking wet. Turn right and go down the hall, then run 
right into that little cloister with stuff piled everywhere. Grab the 
SHOTGUN SHELLS here (they're quite hard to spot). Turn around and exit 
out the single door on the other side.

AQUA RING -- ENCLOSURE FLOOR
--------------------------------

Run along the tank bottom...eventually you come across the body of Shark 
laying on the floor. He's still alive, barely, but is harmless. :p Keep 
going to the end, and wade through the waist-deep water. Don't worry 
about Neptune...she's "dead." ;) Climb up on the grating, then •attempt• 
to press the switch in the box. SPLASH! The box breaks and Neptune is 
actually alive...you can't go back in the water, what to do?!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       BOSS -- Neptune the Shark
------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two ways to do this...

(Stupid) Pump tons of rounds into her body, wasting precious ammo yet
         eventually killing her.

(Smart)  Push that green box (an electrical generator) into the water,
         then flip the lever on the control panel beside you. The water
         will electrify and shock Neptune to death.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

...glad you made the right decision. Hop down into the water again and 
wade around her charcoaled body, picking up the sparkle. Another 
RESIDENCE KEY. Examine it, this one's the GALLERY KEY. Wade out of the 
water then backtrack to the body of the dead shark...grab that (sorta) 
hard to see sparkle beside him. It's the ASSAULT SHOTGUN. Richard must 
have had it on him when he was eaten. This weapon is great, not only 
does it hold 10 shells, instead of a regular Shotgun's six, but just 
look at it -- the things GREAT looking. Head back to the door at the 
beginning of the tank and exit.

AQUA RING -- STORAGE CHAMBER
--------------------------------

Turn right, and head down the hall, exiting out the double doors.

AQUA RING -- EXIT TUNNEL
----------------------------

Run forward and grab the MAGNUM ROUNDS on the box, then climb up the 
ladder at the end of the tunnel. At the top use the door...

AQUA RING -- ACCESS TUNNEL A644-1
-------------------------------------

Run left, and backtrack to the end, using the ladder to climb back out.

ROOM 002
------------

Use the main door and exit into the hall.

INNER HALLWAY
-----------------

Trot around the corner and use the Gallery Key to unlock the adjacent 
door. Discard the key. Before heading in the Gallery, you should go back 
to the Residential Storage (save room) and put EVERYTHING in the Item 
Box, and take out your RED BOOK, along with some other stuff. And do 
remember to SAVE YOUR GAME and then redeposit the Ink Ribbon.

GALLERY
-----------

God, this place is SWARMING with Killer Bees (they can also poison you 
if you're stung enough), so don't try to do ANYTHING in here yet, just 
stay moving! Run forward, then turn left at the table and run down the 
hall. Examine the body laying dead in the corner, uncovering something 
he's holding, INSECTICIDE SPRAY. Gee, wonder what we should do with 
this? 

NOTE: Off to your left is the Killer Bee Hive (it's HUGE!) but you can't
      access it because the swarming is so veracious. 

Turn 180 quickly so you're not stung, and run back down the hall. Turn 
at the table then exit back out the door at the end.

INNER HALLWAY
-----------------

Turn right and pass the door to Room 002, then at the dead end grab the 
RESIDENTIAL MAP. There's a hole behind it, DON'T INSPECT IT (as bees 
will pop out). Just use your Insecticide Spray and Chris will send a 
cloud through, killing the hive in the adjacent hallway. Turn yourself 
around and enter the Gallery again.

GALLERY
-----------

Run forward and grab the HANDGUN MAGAZINE on the table...turn left again 
and go down the hall, then turn left a second time. Grab the sparkle at 
the end, the final RESIDENTIAL KEY. Examine the back of it, where it's 
renamed KEY FOR ROOM 003. Backtrack out of the hallway, and use the key 
to unlock the door on the right. Discard and head in.

ROOM 003
------------

You can SAVE YOUR GAME with the TYPEWRITER on the table if you brought 
Ink Ribbon, but you shouldn't have any if you've been paying attention 
to the inventory checks. ;) Examine the bookcase beside the table, and 
you'll find a row of red books, yet suspiciously the center book is 
white colored. Remove the white book and you get an "Organic Chemistry 
Lab Experiment" file. Now, place the Red Book in the gap. Ding ding, 
puzzle time!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             RED BOOK PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our task is to arrange the "Bandage with Blood" books in the correct 
order so that the naked woman on the book spines is arranged properly. 
Don't know why, she's ugly to begin with, but anyway...

                             _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

                         Exchange books 2 and 7.
                         Exchange books 3 and 8.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Afterwards the nearby bookcase moves, revealing a SECRET DOOR! Prepare 
yourself by equipping the Shotgun. Head through the door...

LAIR OF PLANT 42
--------------------

Here's good ol' planty boy! Unlike Jill Valentine's game, Chris Redfield 
with get a (harmless) hug from the plant before the battle begins.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            BOSS -- Plant 42
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The key here is that once you get in the room, IMMEDIATELY barrel up the 
stairs in front of you, then at the top STAY MOVING while you fire shots 
at the plant's "flower." Mind you the flower has to be OPEN. Keep doing 
that till it dies. It shouldn't take too long...

NOTE: Sometimes when you're on the top balcony, and a vine hits you,
      it'll knock you clear off and onto the GROUND FLOOR. 

SECOND NOTE: When the main "flower" opens, Plant 42 also gets more
             aggressive -- some vines will try to spray you with 
             damaging pollen. 

THIRD NOTE: Also watch those little "buds" found on some of the walls,
            they can spray pollen too!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the threat over, run to the fireplace and grab the sparkle, another 
MANSION KEY. Examine the back of it; the HELMET KEY. Yes, we merely 
trekked all the way over here for the SOLE PURPOSE of just getting 
another key. This fact in particular pissed me off. You can exit the 
room now, except you have to take the double doors, because some 
mysterious fool removed one of the Red Books in the adjacent room 
causing the single door to relock. 

GALLERY
-----------

Chris stumbles upon Rebecca out here, and tells her the bad news. 
Richard is dead! Oh boohoo...at least we got the Assault Shotgun, and 
that's what counts. ;) After Rebecca leaves, exit out the main door, 
going into the Inner Hallway...

INNER HALLWAY
-----------------

Head right, where a cutscene will play; Jill finds Wesker shooting some 
Giant Bees with his Handgun (why?!). Apparently there are some rooms in 
the mansion we still have to explore (duh duh). Exit out the door at the 
end of the hallway...squish the bees on your way out! :p

FRONT HALLWAY
-----------------

You can just run directly over the holes, as Plant 42 wouldn't grab you 
anymore. Round the corner to the right, then round another corner. You 
may want to grab a BLUE HERB from the shelves (just one) in case you get 
poisoned in a bit (as the mansion has no readily available Blue Herb, 
and trust me, you don't want to waste coming all the way out here 
again, I speak from experience). Exit out the front door.

BRICK CORRIDOR
------------------

Follow this all the way to the end and use the gate...

WATERFALL COURTYARD
-----------------------

Well, well, well. Seems some Cerberus have come to greet you. The dog 
right in front of you wouldn't get up until you run right beside him -- 
head for the lift! If you're fast (aka good) you'll make it without 
taking any damage.

STORAGE POOL
----------------

After you step off the lift, run down the path. We have a little snake 
problem to take care of...

See, once you round the corner with the lamp, a "hidden" snake will pop 
out at POINT 1, and attempt to bite you. To avoid this, round the corner 
as tight as possible against the wall at POINT 2. There...the "horror" 
is over. Head down the ladder, run along the path at the bottom, and use 
the other ladder. Exit out the gate.

PILLAR COURTYARD
--------------------

Exit out the wooden double doors in the alcove.

GARDEN SUPPLY SHED
----------------------

Wesker's been here! If you head to the door opposite of you, you'll find 
another brown note on the wall:

"Use this to protect yourself from that monster in chains that can't be 
hurt by guns. I also fixed the doorknob to make sure you can get away.
-Wesker-"

That door with the faulty doorknob in the east of the mansion is now 
fixed. Grab the stuff Wesker left for you, then take the metal door.

VINE PASSAGE
----------------

Head down the passage and use the door at the end, entering the mansion 
building proper again. 

EAST HALLWAY
----------------

Run own the hall piece and round the corner...THE HORROR! ;) A cutscene 
plays showing something following you. Now, those growls and screams are 
coming from a "Hunter," Which basically looks like a guy in a frog suit, 
not nearly as scary as Crimson Head. However Hunters are more dangerous, 
as sometimes they'll do a "Leap Attack" where they claw your head 
killing you instantly. Now some people say it decapitates you, but I've 
never actually seen the removed head. You can either take this Hunter 
out or do the smart thing and exit out the side door by the chair.

BOTTOM OF EAST STAIRS
-------------------------

Run down the hall, and watch yourself, another Hunter is waiting here 
for you. Take the side door entering the save room.

EAST STAIRS STORAGE ROOM

Head left, and run down the hall, rounding the corner. Use the end door.

FIREPLACE STUDY
-------------------

Herbs off to your side...open the other door using your Helmet Key and 
exit out.

ART GALLERY
---------------

Could also be called "Room of the Crushing Walls of a Horrible Squishy 
Death by Proxy." But I like my name better. :p We have another puzzle, 
and this one is pretty hard, as if you screw up you'll die and find out 
what a pancake feels like.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              STATUE PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run ahead, and immediately push the grey statue FORWARD, as it AWAY from 
the wall. Keep pushing it to the next chamber, where the two walls will 
begin to crush inwards. They CAN'T hurt you, you have the statue as 
protection. Push the statue ALL the way to the VERY end.

Turn yourself around and run down the narrow space. When in the next 
little area, take the other passage. We're actually behind the wall now! 
Run all the way to the end and examine the alcove on the wall. OK, 
here's where it gets hard.

• Hit the switch, causing the walls to start retracting.
• Flip yourself around, and backtrack to the other area.
• Take the other passage again, and run down to the statue.
• Push it LEFT, until it covers that square with the "N". 
• A secret passage is revealed! 

The camera angles seem to make this puzzle much harder then it should 
be...but ah well, you'll get it eventually, that is if you don't die a 
horrible death in the meantime. :p

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head through the passage and go to the left. Examine the dresser to get 
a DAGGER. Turn around and go to the other side, where you find a hole. 
Say "yes" to pop on in.

GEORGE TREVOR'S CRAPPY GRAVE
--------------------------------

Who turned out the lights? Run forward and grab the LAST BOOK VOL.1 
laying on the ground. On your status screen examine the edge of the book 
where you can see the length of the pages. The book will open up, 
revealing a MEDAL OF EAGLE. Head forward some more, and check the 
gravestone to get a file -- "George Trevor's Diary." It's so long, and 
my eyes glaze over most of the time before I finish it. Say "yes" to 
hitting the switch, which reveals a hole and a ladder. Head down...

BASEMENT CORRIDOR
---------------------  

There are some Giant Spiders in this area, and they're acid spit will 
poison you. But, there's a Blue Herb in the next area, so you can pretty 
much ignore them. 

Head forward and round the corner, ignoring the first spider. Travel 
down, then go to the right. Grab the B1 MANSION MAP on the wall. Round 
another corner, and examine the •seemingly• useless stack of boxes...you 
get some more SHOTGUN SHELLS. Turn around, go around the corner, and 
backtrack, this time taking the left way. Watch the second spider! Round 
a final corner and use the door at the end...

GENERATOR CORRIDOR
----------------------

This corridor has a layer of water at the bottom...interesting. Round 
the first corner and use the Blue Herb if you need it. Keep going till 
you reach the fork (two Zombies will greet you) and grab the DAGGER on 
the floor. Head through the gated passage. Go around the flooded corner 
and at the end examine the machine on the wall. Say "yes" to switching 
the fusepack, thus restoring power to the elevator. Backtrack around the 
corner and to the fork, this time taking the other way (watch the 
Zombies). Head to the end and exit out.

NOTE: Yes, I am aware there is a HANDGUN MAGAZINE hidden in the shelf
      unit by the door. But as a Chris Redfield player, you can't get it
      if you want an open space in your inventory (and you DO)!

KITCHEN
-----------

OK...let me get this straight, the floor of the previous corridor was 
flooded, but the Kitchen's floor isn't? Even though they're on the same 
level. And clearly the door between them isn't waterproof...arg. Anyway, 
on the opposite side of the table from you is a Zombie, which should be 
approaching at a snail's pace. Wait for it to come a few paces from you, 
then go around the other side of the table. At the back round the corner 
into a small side area (no, that guy wouldn't magically wake up all 
crimsony). Go to the elevator and say "yes" to bring it down. Press A 
when it reaches you.

Wait. Where's my elevator music?! *pops in Jet Force Gemini soundtrack* 

ELEVATOR HALLWAY
--------------------

Head to the right, and round the corner.

NOTE: Off to your left is some herbs, but it's hardly worth it. The
      plants are in a dead end and there's a Zombie keeping watch.

A Zombie greets you...get past it, then open that first door here.

CLOSET
----------

At your feet to the left is some SHOTGUN SHELLS, and some...SHOTGUN 
SHELLS! Yummy metallic goodness. Head forward and examine the floor by 
the desk for a FLASH GRENADE, then check the desk itself for the 
BATTERY. This Battery will activate a lift in the Courtyard...exit the 
room. Notice how you have (should) one space open in your inventory!

ELEVATOR HALLWAY
--------------------
 
We've come out of the closet! *snicker* Turn to the left and run down 
the hall, unlocking the door. Exit out.

YELLOW CORRIDOR
-------------------

A Crimson Head and a normal Zombie are in here (unless you killed 
them...), except they're up ahead and will try to ambush you from two 
directions. Be CAREFUL, or you could be a Chris sandwich before you know 
it. ;) Head forward and turn to the right, running down the long hall. 

*breaths heavily* Whip left around the corner (CRIMSON!) then cross 
through that little gap with the mirror, then turn right, running down 
the hall and exiting out the door.

KNIGHTS' HALLWAY
--------------------

Trot up the stairs and head to the end, where you open the door with 
your Helmet Key...head into the abyss.

LIBRARY
-----------
Some Green Herb ahead; might want to use it to health yourself to "FINE" 
and/or take one with you. Run down the window hall and head around the 
corner where the first bookcases are. DUN DUN! Out pops Yawn again! The 
bastard never gives up...and you can't run away this time! 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 BOSS -- Yawn the Python, strikes back!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

First you need to turn yourself around and get down that ladder as 
quickly as you can. If you stay up on this ledge, Yawn can actually 
SWALLOW you in one bite -- not pretty. All right, here's a strategy that 
I've found works GREAT: 
 
Time for a little game of "Run Around the Mulberry Bush" with Yawny boy.


                            LIBRARY SCHEMATIC
            .----------------.----------------------------.
            |          Ladder|                            |
            |         _______|                 .-----.    |
            |        |                         |     |    |
            |        |                         |  s  |    |
            |        |                         |  h  |    |
            |        |                         |  e  |    |
            |        |              (1)        |  l  |    |
            |        |                         |  f  |    |
            |        |                         '-----'    |
            |        |                                    |
            '--------'------------------------------------'


Make sure to equip your fully-loaded Shotgun. Now, get Yawn to follow 
behind you as you run from the bottom of the ladder, and run COUNTER-
clockwise around the shelf. Don't run too fast, as you want Yawn to 
follow at a comfortable distance. Once you run BACK to point (1), whip 
around and wait. To the right of you Yawn's tail should be wagging in 
the breeze, and Yawn should rear up and come after you from behind the 
shelf. FIRE AT WILL! When Yawn gets too close for comfort, run around 
the shelf again...

Hitting Yawn's head and "neck" brings him down faster than injuring the 
length of his body.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The death animation of Yawn is quite gruesome (and he's DEAD FOR GOOD), 
causing some books on the nearby shelf to be thrown to the floor. But 
more importantly a sparkle is revealed! Run behind the shelf and pick up 
the sparkle -- LAST BOOK VOL.2 -- and just like the first book, examine 
the long side of the pages on the status screen. You'll pull out a MEDAL 
OF WOLF. Now head back up the ladder, and backtrack to the beginning. 
Exit out the door...

KNIGHTS' HALLWAY
--------------------

Head down to the beginning and exit out.

YELLOW CORRIDOR

Enter inside...can you feel the anticipation?!

EAGLE STATUETTE ROOM
------------------------

Grab the SHOTGUN SHELLS on you right, on the shelf below the Deer head. 
Run to the other side of the room, and grab the DAGGER sitting to the 
left of the Buffalo head. Trot over to that table between the two 
dressers and pick up a "Mail from the Chief of Security" file. It's 
puzzle time!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            GEMSTONE PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you should have already noticed (unless you're blind) that Eagle 
Statuette follows you whenever you run around the room. Suspicious? Yes. 
So what are we going to do about it? Simple. Run back to the door, and 
flick the light switch beside it to turn the lights off in the room. The 
eyes in the Eagle glow bright purple. An eye in the Deer head glows red, 
and an eye in Buffalo head glows yellow. 

Push both of the cabinets forward so they're against the walls and 
underneath the animal heads. Now, here's the trick with the Eagle:

• The Eagle will lock on and follow you if you're running in its VIEW.

• If you run AGAINST the wall on which the Eagle is mounted, you'll pass
  BELOW its view, causing it not to follow you.

Now, get the Eagle to lock on to the Buffalo head (the eyes will flash). 
Pass below the Eagle, then quickly hop on top of the cabinet below the 
Deer head and examine the head. Take out the RED GEMSTONE. Now just 
repeat this process, but opposite, for the Buffalo to get the YELLOW 
GEMSTONE. Now you can take your pansy self outta here...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

WEST STAIRS HALLWAY
----------------------- 

Head left, then run down the stairs.

BOTTOM OF WEST STAIRS
-------------------------

Go around the corner and the pillar. Round the next corner...you'll be 
having lunch with two Hunters in a matter of moments. Run forward past 
the first window -- SHATTER. Hunter number one pops in. Run past the 
other window -- SHATTER. Another Hunter pops in. Run your little Chris 
legs to the end of the hall and exit out the END door.

LONG WINDOW HALLWAY
-----------------------

Immediately turn left and run down the way. Turn left, into that little 
alcove piece. Use the door...

TIGER ALTAR ROOM
--------------------

Position yourself in front of the Tiger Statue and place in the Yellow 
Gemstone. It'll revolve and give up an MO DISK. This we'll use in a bit. 
Exit the room.

LONG WINDOW HALLWAY
-----------------------

Run out of the little alcove, then turn left, and run down that long 
strip of hallway. Exit out the end door.

KENNETH HALLWAY
-------------------

Trot to the right and use the door.

DINING ROOM
---------------

Turn right, running down along the table. Use the double doors.

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

Run yourself straight across the room to the double doors on the 
opposite side. Use your Helmet Key and open the single door just to the 
left. Discard the key and enter...

SCIENCE ROOM
----------------

Off to your right you should notice that jar housing a green liquid and 
a human digestive system. But more importantly, pick up the "undated 
note" sitting beside the jar. Speaks something about an "art room." Head 
around the shelves and turn left. Run to the end and examine the 
bookcase to get some INK RIBBON. Flip around, then run down this hall 
and use the door. 

WARDROBE ROOM                
-----------------     

Oooh, a Zombie! Get around him, and in the area opposite the mirror we 
have GREEN HERB and a BLUE HERB TERRACE. Grab the DAGGER on the floor, 
then the JEWELRY BOX sitting in the cabinet. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              JIGSAW PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We had every puzzle-type except the classic jigsaw. You knew it was 
coming! The impression on the top of the Jewelry Box is in the shape of 
an octagon. You have to arrange the pieces so they fit perfectly inside. 
The easiest way is to start with the largest piece and work your way 
down in size. Piece 2 goes in the very center, e.g. the last one you 
use. All the pieces:
                                  __
                                 /  \

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

With the puzzle solved, the Jewelry Box opens, revealing a BROACH. 
Examine the Broach further (press A), and at the bottom out folds a key. 
We have the EMBLEM KEY, the final key in the Mansion. Wew. Now leave the 
room before that Zombie gives yah a hug.

SCIENCE ROOM

Run down the hall then turn right, exiting out the door.

MANSION FOYER

Now QUICKLY run to the gray door with the emblem on it. Open it with 
your Emblem Key (yah, really). Discard the key and enter inside.

SPENCERS' ROOM
------------------

A few seconds after entering, you hear Rebecca scream like a little 
pansy. Chris -- "Rebecca?! Is she upstairs?!". HINT HINT. We need to go 
save her so exit the room (oh yes we do, unless you don't want the sweet 
second battle with the final boss).

Egads, Rebecca is in trouble? Who would have thunk that? As hilarious as 
it is to see Rebecca coward in the corner as a Hunter is about to turn 
her face into Swiss cheese, we need to save her...boohoo. Kill the 
Hunter with a few shells. Now watch, point, and laugh as his body 
convulses and dies. Dance with it -- DANCE I SAID, DANCE! ;) When 
Rebecca finally slinks off (I love it when she says "I can take care of 
myself") use the door behind her, and just head downstairs to the save 
room again.

down now!

SPENCERS' ROOM
------------------

If you examine the things in the room, the game will tell you it's too 
dark to see anything. But before you try to whip out your Lighter, walk 
to the desk and examine the lamp. Press "yes" to turn it on! That fooled 
me the first time! Examine the shelf just LEFT of the lamp to reveal 
some well hidden SHOTGUN SHELLS. Now turn around, and on that small 
cabinet, grab the FLASH GRENADE on one corner, and the ever-elusive and 
spiffy METAL OBJECT on the other corner. Doesn't the object look 
familiar?! Exit the room.

EAST HALLWAY
----------------

Head left, round the corner, and exit out the metal door. Fresh air...

VINE PASSAGE

PILLAR COURTYARD
--------------------

If Cerberus are still here, clean them ALL out with your Shotgun before 
moving on. Head up the stairs and use the gate.

STORAGE POOL
----------------

Pop down the ladder, running along the bottom. Use the other ladder then 
run along the path (watch the Snake by the lamp). Use the lift.

WATERFALL COURTYARD
-----------------------

Pace...pace...pace. Two Cerberus are here (unless you killed them WAY 
before, while exiting the Residence) The goal is to make sure BOTH of 
them don't gang up on you at the same time. With Shotgun in hand, run 
kamikaze at the first dog, which is taking a nap to the left of the 
waterfall. BANG! Now run between the pillars and down the steps (if the 
other dog hasn't already spotted you). Dog -- BANG! Beside the fountain 
is another lift...yet, it has no power and there's a strange box beside 
it spiting out sparks. Hyuk hyuk! Place your Battery in the box to 
restart the power. Ride the lift up...

PILLAR COURTYARD
--------------------

We went in a circle -- how quaint. Head back to the steps and use the 
metal gate again...

STORAGE POOL
----------------

Run forward then go off to the right. Use your Square Crank on the hole 
again, filling the pool with water. The game says a waterfall has 
stopped. Duh...hint? Flip around then exit out the gate.

PILLAR COURTYARD
--------------------

Head down the stairs, round the pillars, use the lift...

WATERFALL COURTYARD
-----------------------

Trot up the steps then run over to where the waterfall use to be. 
Surprise surprise, a passage has been uncovered in the back after the 
water was drained. Head in.

BEHIND THE WATERFALL
------------------------

Run down the long passage and use the ladder at the end. Candles? Who 
lit candles? Ahem... :p

MINING AREA -- MAIN TUNNEL
------------------------------

I hate this part. I repeat, I hate this part. It has got to be the most 
BORING part of the ENTIRE game! Whoever designed it should be fired! You 
could run forward and find a TYPEWRITER, ITEM BOX, and a dead end. Or, 
you could just take that side door -- which is what you should do!

MINING AREA -- WINDY TUNNEL
-------------------------------

Run forward, then turn left. There's a huge boulder with wind blowing 
out from behind it. Trot down the stairs and use the door at the end.

MINING AREA -- INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR
--------------------------------------

Head just to the left and grab the HANDGUN MAGAZINE on the floor. That 
gapping hole is the elevator (or at least where it should be...). Run 
around the elevator, then head into that alcove with the machinery. 
Examine that square panel, the main power console. Say "yes" to removing 
the SHAFT. No jokes please... ;) Run out of the alcove and head down 
that corridor...grab the HANDGUN MAGAZINE in the pool of water (quite 
hard to see) then use the door.

MINING AREA -- ENRICO TUNNEL
--------------------------------

Trot forward a bit and a cutscene automatically starts playing. We meet 
Enrico, another fellow S.T.A.R.S. officer. There's a double crosser on 
the team...

"Um...brel...la"

And then BANG, he's dead with a handgun blast to the heart. Somebody was 
just around the corner. Examine Enrico's body and Chris will find he's 
holding something -- a CRANK. Examine its tip so it's renamed HEXAGON 
CRANK. Lucky you, it should fill up the last space in your inventory.

Now head back to the door. Right before you reach the door it swings 
open and a Hunter pops out. UH hello! Dodge him then take the door.

MINING AREA -- INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR
--------------------------------------

Run down the hall, around the elevator, and exit out the other door.

MINING AREA -- WINDY TUNNEL
-------------------------------

Trot forward, then wait at the bottom of the stairs -- ANOTHER Hunter. 
Kill the Hunter waiting at the top of the stairs, but don't waste ammo 
on the other guy (we definitely don't want both Hunters to sandwich us 
in). Exit out the door.

MINING AREA -- MAIN TUNNEL
------------------------------

Follow the around the corner. Ah, safety. Deposit EVERYTHING away except 
your crank.

Now grab the INK RIBBON beside the typewriter and save your game. 
Remember to deposit the ribbon in the Item Box! Round the next corner 
and you find the dead end -- but there's a panel on the left wall with a 
hexagonal-shaped hole. I wonder; use your crank on it, causing the 
tunnel section to flip over. Run across the path, and grab that GREEN 
HERB in the corner before exiting out the door.

MINING AREA -- BOULDER TUNNEL
---------------------------------

Right beside you, grab the FLAMETHROWER sitting on the hooks...the hooks 
trigger the door right behind you to lock. Immediately equip this 
spiffy-looking, though ultimately pathetic weapon. To the left is a dead 
end, but to the right is a suspicious boulder blocking the passage. Run 
over to the boulder and check it...flip around and begin to walk away. 
KATHUNK! The boulder has broken lose and will kill you instantly if it 
touches you! Run down the tunnel and duck into the alcove with the door. 
If you don't feel like Indiana Jones now, you never will. 

After that danger is done, run back to where the boulder originally was 
for some well hidden SHOTGUN SHELLS. Turn around and run the other 
direction -- the boulder has broken a new passage -- exit out the door.

NOTE: Clearly I was equipped with a Flamethrower. But when Chris dived
      into the alcove he wasn't holding a weapon. LAZY Capcom! Oh well,
      at least Chris does that neat "jumping-roll" unlike Jill... :p

MINING AREA -- SPIDERS' NEST
--------------------------------

Holy fruit salad! Everything is covered in spiderwebs, and from the 
ceiling a GIGANTIC Spider crawls down. Boss time...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          BOSS -- Queen Spider
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This battle is pretty easy, but don't expect as big of a cakewalk as 
when you were playing as Jill. You should use the Flamethrower for this 
fight so you don't waste any ammo...but due to the short range, you're 
going to have to get right up in her face. Fire a stream at her from the 
side or from behind, then when she tries to turn and face you, move and 
fire again. Sometimes when the Queen charges at you, it just ends up 
"pushing" Chris meaning you can fire the entire time while moving 
backwards! Hilarious to watch. After about 30 seconds the queen is dead, 
and don't worry if she nails you with acid spit, you have a Green Herb 
and there's a Blue Herb in the next tunnel. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The major threat is over, but there's still two "normal" (whatever that 
is) Giant Spiders in the room. I usually use a few flame bursts (if I 
have any fuel left) and take them both out, because they're highly 
annoying. 

NOTE: If you check out the Queen Spider's body, her abdomen should have
      been ruptured. Tons of tiny Spiders are pouring out -- you can
      squish them! Good for satisfying a perverse nature (or at least
      mine). Heh. :p 

Run over to the wooden crates and grab the sparkle, a SURVIVAL KNIFE. 
YEAH! Wait, a, second...that's crappy! See, Capcom was extremely kind 
with you by not making you run all the way back to the Item Box to get 
your original Survival Knife. You need to use this knife and slash away 
the spider web strands that are blocking the door. After you're done 
cleaning, exit out.

MINING AREA -- SIDE TUNNEL
------------------------------

Run to the left, where there's a dead end with some BLUE HERB. Also grab 
the B1 COURTYARD MAP posted on the bulletin board. Turn around and head 
the other way. At the end, place your Flamethrower on the two hooks to 
unlock the adjacent door. Head through...

MINING AREA -- ANOTHER BOULDER TUNNEL
-----------------------------------------

Run forward and go around the corner. We're greeted with the familiar 
sight of a dead end and a hexagonal hole panel. Use your crank on the 
hole to flip the tunnel -- except use it THREE TIMES. After the third 
time (remember to exit your status screen) the boulder across the way 
breaks lose. 

RUN CHRIS RUN! Turn around and run down the tunnel, ducking around the 
corner. Wew...round the corner again, and run down ALL THE WAY to the 
end. In this little area that was blocked by the boulder we find a FIRST 
AID BOX, which when examined gives you a FIRST AID SPRAY. Turn around, 
and take the side tunnel. Exit out the door.

MINING AREA -- GODDESS STATUE CHAMBER
-----------------------------------------

We have another puzzle here. The object of it is to get that loose 
Goddess Statue positioned by the wall, and push it over and into the 
alcove by the other statue.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             GODDESS PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

• Push the loose statue along the wall to the right, so it rests in
  front of that dark panel.

• Use your Hexagon Crank on the hole by the door. The dark panel will
  move out into the room, pushing the statue.

• Use your crank a second time, retracting the dark panel.

• Run over to the Goddess Statue and push it towards that circle panel
  on the floor, then push it FORWARD onto the circle. The statue will
  turn 90 degrees.

• Move the statue off the circle panel, then push it back on by pushing
  it FORWARD. The statue turns another 90 degrees.

• Now just move the statue over into the alcove!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

GOD the camera angles make that puzzle almost unbearable! After the 
statue is back in its alcove the center panel raises revealing an item. 
Pick up the CYLINDER. You can exit the chamber now...

MINING AREA -- ANOTHER BOULDER TUNNEL
-----------------------------------------

Head around the corner then backtrack all the way to the entry door. 
Exit through it.

MINING AREA -- SIDE TUNNEL
------------------------------

Most people will forget this, but -- MAKE SURE to grab the FLAMETHROWER 
off the hooks. The next task is just to backtrack all the way to the 
Main Tunnel (place with the Typewriter). Enroute, redeposit the 
Flamethrower on its original hooks to unlock the door again. I'm sure 
you'll manage...

MINING AREA -- MAIN TUNNEL
------------------------------

Deposit everything in the Item Box EXCEPT the Cylinder, then take out 
the Shaft. Combine the Cylinder and Shaft on your status screen to get a 
CYLINDER SHAFT (there's so many jokes I could crack right about now). 
Examine the Cylinder Shaft further on the status screen and the game 
will tell you if you want to turn it...say "yes." Turn it enough times 
and on the curved side four Roman numerals will be formed:

                           IV   II   III   I

Which is 4, 2, 3, 1, for you "challenged" people. All you should have in 
your inventory is the Cylinder Shaft. You might want too SAVE YOUR GAME 
too. Head around the corner and use the door by the ladder.

Run around the elevator and head into the alcove. Place the Cylinder 
Shaft into the main console on the machinery -- you have to get around a 
little security feature consisting of four buttons. The solution is so 
obvious I wouldn't even bother telling you...

...alright, alright. Press buttons 4, 2, 3, 1.  ;) 

The power is restored to the elevator, and it raises itself to your 
level. Run on to the elevator and examine the console -- say "yes" to go 
down...

MINING BRIDGE
-----------------

After the elevator stops, get off and run forward, using the door.

CIRCULAR TUNNEL COMPLEX
---------------------------

Head down the tunnel and midway you hear a door swing open. Hmmm...keep 
going, and at the fork go right -- LISA TREVOR! AHH MOMMY! She appears 
whichever direction you take first. Turn around and head left, following 
the circular tunnel (don't turn in that little side tunnel) and trot up 
the stairs. Take the door in the alcove.

CARGO UPLOAD
----------------

There's lots of cargo crates around, hence the name. Head forward and go 
around the corner to the next little area. In the other corner you 
should notice a massive stack of crates. Climb the first (tan) crate, 
then climb up the next (green) crate, then run up the brown bags. At the 
very top you hit the motherload -- a FLASH GRENADE, HANDGUN MAGAZINE, 
and MAGNUM ROUNDS. *faints*

Get back down to the ground, and see that brown crate? Push it slightly 
to the left then forward onto the materials lift. Examine the console, 
sending it on it's way. You may exit now.

CIRCULAR TUNNEL COMPLEX
---------------------------

Head to the right, there appears Lisa Trevor. So turn around and take 
the left tunnel (keep in mind that switch on the wall that you pass) and 
turn into the exit tunnel. Follow it to the end and use the door.

MINING BRIDGE
-----------------

Run forward and examine the elevator console -- "It's broken". Arg. 
Surprise surprise. Guess we're taking the back way -- cross the bridge 
(Item Box), and climb down the ladder at the end.

MATERIALS DROPOFF POINT
---------------------------

Head to the left -- there's your crate on the lift. Push it left, off 
the elevator. Then push it forward so it drops into that "pit." Examine 
the console and turn on the "Garbage Compactor." Classic. The crate is 
crushed, revealing a shiny item, which you should hop down and collect. 
The BROKEN FLAMETHROWER! Get out of this pit and take the ladder again.

MINING BRIDGE
----------------- 

Cross the bridge and use the door by the elevator again.

CIRCULAR TUNNEL COMPLEX
---------------------------

Run down the first tunnel to the end...OK, this is where we can actually 
manipulate Lisa Trevor to our own ends. Turn left, and she'll appear. 
Now go to the right. Around the first corner you should see lever on the 
wall. IGNORE IT FOR RIGHT NOW! Wait in front of it; Lisa Trevor will 
slink over. Right as she's breathing down your neck, hit that funky 
lever -- nearby a panel sprouts two hooks.

NOTE: You're probably wondering why we waited till the last minute to
      hit the lever. It's simple really, we don't want Lisa giving us a
      birthday surprise and going the other way through the tunnel
      rather than following behind.  

The hooks don't last forever (time limit), so run to the right, head 
down the stairs, and turn into that side tunnel -- here's the panel with 
hooks and a door. Use your Broken Flamethrower on the hooks and the door 
unlocks. Exit out.

LISA TREVOR'S HOME
----------------------

Head forward and enter through the gate. This places looks like a cross 
between "Child's Play" (Chucky) and "Indiana Jones and the Temple of 
Doom"! Run around the center structure of wood and candles then enter 
the partly submerged tunnel. MOVE IT! This place is swarming with 
snakes. Once you reach the end you come to another candlelight room -- 
check off to your left. 

Grab the JEWELRY BOX sitting on the shelf, and examine its lid on your 
status screen to take out a STONE RING. You also get "A family picture 
and notes" file. Climb up the ladder. At the top head to the left and 
climb up another ladder to exit outside.

NOTE: If you got poisoned by the Snakes in the water tunnel, head to the
      right to find a dead end, some water barrels, and a BLUE HERB.  

CABIN
---------

Aha! I always thought that board looked suspicious ever since we got the 
Square Crank! Head down the dusty hall and pull yourself up to the 
wooden floor. Check the Item Box at the end and pull out your Metal 
Object. Combine the Metal Object with the Stone Ring on your status 
screen to get -- brace yourself -- a second STONE & METAL OBJECT. Tadah! 

Your can deposit everything else from your inventory in the box, just 
make sure to keep the Stone & Metal Object.

SPECIALTY ITEMS TO COLLECT:
-------------------------------

1. Stone & Metal Object



GARDEN SUPPLY SHED
----------------------

Head forward and use the metal door...

VINE PASSAGE
----------------

Trot over to the shelf depression on the wall and remove the second 
STONE & METAL OBJECT. The door subsequently locks behind you. You should 
now have two of the octagonal beauties. Follow the passage and exit out 
the other door.

EAST HALLWAY
----------------

Run down the hall piece and exit out the door in the corner.

PORTRAIT GALLERY
--------------------

Follow the hall to the end and use the gate.

GRAVEYARD
-------------

Head right, trot up both sets of stairs, then use the door.

MANSION FOYER
-----------------

If you did any exploring in this room earlier in the game, you should 
remember that locked gate beneath the stairs. Head down this set of 
stairs, then go either left or right and head down another set of 
stairs...you come to a little hallway. Examine the large gate in the 
center -- it's locked, for now at least. Place in BOTH of your Stone & 
Metal Objects, causing them to fit snugly in each door. Head through.

STAIRWAY PASSAGE
--------------------

This place is TINY, and you wouldn't be spending much time here. At the 
top of the stairs is a TYPEWRITER and at the bottom is an ITEM BOX. You 
should take out your Medal of Eagle and Medal of Wolf.

Make sure to SAVE YOUR GAME! Head down several sets of stairs, and at 
the bottom follow the haphazard catwalk. Use the door at the end.

INNER SANCTUM TUNNEL
------------------------

Even more candles! Run down the steps and at the bottom descend the 
ladder. Prepare yourself...

THE TOMB
------------

Here we find Wesker firing Handgun rounds at Lisa Trevor. After he 
notices Chris he tells him to take a piece of the action...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  BOSS -- Lisa Trevor, back for more!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Magnum Rounds are precious in a Chris Redfield game, so we're going to 
use the "Stones" strategy to beat Lisa. See those four stones at each 
corner of the platform? Well all you have to do is push them off and 
into the pit. A cool trick I learned is you can actually get Lisa Trevor 
to knock them off! Stand in front of a stone, and wait for Lisa to slink 
over...right as she's about to smack you, GET OUT OF THE WAY! Hopefully 
she'll hit the stone send it flying.

Whichever way you use, once all four stones are gone, the stone casket 
will open, revealing Lisa's mother. Lisa takes the skull and then jumps 
into the pit...

NOTE: After Wesker takes his position beneath the ladder, he serves as
      an excellent distraction. BUT BEWARE, he CAN get knocked into the
      pit by Lisa just like Barry on a Jill game. If he gets knocked
      off, I'd recommend starting over.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, didn't that strategy make the other guides look like melted cheese? 
:p After the gate retracts, exit through. Run down the tunnel and take 
the elevator at the end.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            C O U R T Y A R D
------------------------------------------------------------------------



FOUNTAIN MONUMENT
---------------------

Run forward and round the corner. Here we have a large pool of water. 
There are two places along the wall of the pool that have ornate 
decoration -- place your Medal of Eagle and Medal of Wolf in these 
places. Two hidden doors open draining out the water. Find the gap in 
the wall, head through, then trot down the stairs. Press A to take the 
elevator you find at the bottom.

• SWITCH TO DISK 2...highly illogical. I mean, why not have a disk per
  character, or something that actually makes sense? And the disk is a 
  terribly hard to get out of the game case -- it feels like I'm going
  to BREAK THE DANG THING!

MACHINERY ROOM
------------------

In this area, all loose-ends in the story are tied, all rights are 
wronged, and we get to fight a mean final boss! This area should take 
about 20 minutes to complete. 25 minutes if you're going to complete the 
MO Disk scenario (which WILL be covered in the guide). Head around the 
machine at the center of the room and take the ladder in the alcove.

LAB ENTRANCE
----------------

Nab the INK RIBBON sitting at your feet, and you should obviously SAVE 
your game using the TYPEWRITER. Beside it is an ITEM BOX, and in your 
inventory you should have...absolutely nuthin'! Exit out the door.

UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR
---------------------

Many Zombies in this hall, so be careful, but DON'T KILL THEM. Head down 
this hallway and round the corner. Head down, and turn left, where a 
sparkle awaits you at the end on top of a pile of debris -- an MO DISK. 
Collect it and head right, trotting down the stairs. At the bottom use 
the double doors.  

DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR
-----------------------

Turn right, and use the other door. 

PATIENT HALLWAY
-------------------

Collect that FIRST AID BOX at your feet and examine it to get MIXED 
HERB, containing two Green Herb. Take the door just to your left.

ROENTGENOGRAM ROOM
----------------------

Run over and grab the sparkle sitting on the box, an X-RAY. If you 
examine it on the status screen, you'll find it belongs to somebody 
named "Clark David". Subsequently the X-ray is renamed X-RAY OF CLARK. 

Trot farther into the room and examine the computer setup to the right. 
You get a "Researcher's letter"; read the whole thing for some good 
background info. You also learn a screename and password to access the 
Umbrella computer system, which flashes on screen when you're done:

                          "...JOHN......ADA..." 

Check the bulletin board to the left to get another X-RAY. Examine it. 
This one belongs "Gail Holland" and is renamed X-RAY OF GAIL. You also 
find a note:

"To use the electronic door, place the initials in alphabetical order."

*sniff sniff* I smell a puzzle! 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              X-RAY PUZZLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The whole goal of this puzzle is to determine the password that will 
allow you to unlock the door on basement floor 2 (remember it mentioned 
in the letter) via the Umbrella computer system. If you observe the 
diagram on the bulletin board, you'll notice human organs. Take note of 
their locations:

• Esophagus
• Lungs
• Liver
• Stomach
• Large Intestine
• Small Intestine
• Colon

Now, on the other board (where there's already two X-rays up), place the 
X-Ray of Clark in the left blank, and the X-Ray of Gail in the right 
blank. Which strangely, makes them in alphabetic order of ABCDEFGH. ;) 
Now run back to the door, and on the wall beside it, hit the light 
switch -- the room glows in a red light, and highlights a portion of 
each X-Ray in red.

The organs that glowed red, from left to right, were: Colon, Esophagus, 
Liver, Lungs. If you take the first letter of each organ, you end up 
with the word "CELL."

Password to Basement Floor 2: CELL 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now all you have to do is exit the room. Amazing, yes?

PATIENT HALLWAY
------------------

Take the door adjacent to you...

DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR
-----------------------

Run forward and head down that narrow tunnel. There's a ZOMBIE in here, 
and barely any room to maneuver, so be careful. At the end of the tunnel 
take the double doors off to the left.

MEDICAL RESEARCH LAB
------------------------

What the hell happened here? Blood streaks on the floor with cockroaches 
all over them? Trot forward from the door and check that console on the 
left wall -- it's beside that "arm" thing. You get some MAGNUM ROUNDS. 
Trot to the other side of the room and enter through that little door to 
the freezer...hey how's it hangin' guys (couldn't resist). Check the 
sparkles on the shelf for a FLASH GRENADE and a FIRST AID BOX -- examine 
the box for a GREEN HERB. That's kinda sucky! I usually just use it 
right away so it doesn't clutter the inventory. Exit the freezer and 
trot over to the computer desk. Check just to the right of the PC for a 
"V-ACT" file. Now examine the computer... 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              l33t h4x0r !
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the login screen pops up, type in:

Login:    JOHN
Password: ADA

• When the floor selection screen comes up, select the second basement
  floor to unlock it. Password: CELL 

• Select the third floor and unlock that too.

• You can now "cancel" and "quit."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can exit the room now...

DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR
-----------------------

Head right, run down the tunnel, and take the double doors straight 
across the way (NOT the one to the stairs).

PATIENT HALLWAY
-------------------

Run down the hall and take the green door off to the right.

CHEMISTRY RESEARCH LAB
--------------------------

Grab the INK RIBBON on the chair and the MAGNUM ROUNDS sitting in the 
sink. Run forward, and on the counter grab that circular container with 
the red lid -- the SLIDE FILTER. Round the corner to the next area, 
ZOMBIE! Get around it and grab the sparkle on the side desk; a "FAX" 
file. Check the main desk to find a GameCubesque Data Reader, which you 
should use your MO Disk on (you should have one in your inventory; got 
it in the Upstairs Corridor). One of the locks on a security door is 
green-lighted. Now exit the room before that Zombie gives you a hug... 

PATIENT HALLWAY
-------------------

Head left, running down the hall. Use the double green doors.

DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR
----------------------

Take the grated double doors adjacent to you.

UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR
---------------------

Run up the stairs, and at the top run parallel to the stairs, head 
around the corner, and use the door at the end.

LAB ENTRANCE
----------------

Ditch all the supplies you collected -- just keep your Slide Filter. 
Take out the MO Disk you stored in the Item Box from earlier (from the 
mansion; yellow gemstone). Exit out using the doors.

Run down the hall, then go around the corner. Run down this hall and 
turn left. Take the double doors, as they're open now! 

VISUAL DATA ROOM
--------------------

Just to the right of the door (on the bookcase), grab the (last) MO DISK 
sparkling like nobody's business. You should have two MO Disk in your 
inventory now. Just to the left of the door (on the glass case), examine 
it to get a LABORATORY MAP. Grab the FIRST AID SPRAY on the end of the 
table. Trot around the table, and on the other side you find a projector 
-- use your Slide Filter on it, allowing you to view the Umbrella 
briefing in a sexy red tint. 

Scroll through slides of the different "Bio-Organic Weapons" (hey, I 
didn't just make up these enemy names!) and at the end you get to see a 
picture of the development team. The very last slide shows a bar-code, 
but only four numbers are visible: 8642.

NOTE: On the slide of the development team, did you notice Wesker
      standing on the right side? Ahem... ;) 

SECOND NOTE: If you viewed the slides without the Slide Filter, they
             would have appeared white. At the end the bar-code would be
             complete, meaning you wouldn't get the special combination.
             On HARD MODE the combination is different...

Run back to the door. To the right of it on a pillar you should notice 
the keypad (has a light on top of it). Examine the keypad and input 
"8462" -- nearby, a hidden door will open. Oh, a secret room behind a 
mirror! Clever! *cough* Run over to where the door is, and examine the 
•tall• bookcase to find a "Security Protocols" file. Examine the •low• 
bookcase to find some SHOTGUN SHELLS. 

Head through the door, and grab the LABORATORY KEY. Examine it and it's 
renamed KEY FOR THE POWER AREA. On the opposite wall is a VCR where you 
can view Kenneth's Film that you got WAY back in the beginning of the 
game. But the film really pisses me off:

• He's a highly-trained S.T.A.R.S. police officer.
• He's got a weapon.
• It's a SHOTGUN.
• HE'S FACING •ONE• ZOMBIE AND IT'S TEN FEET AWAY!

GAH! If I was there, not only would the Zombie be dead, but I'd be 
wearing it's head as a hat! Well, you can completely exit this room now, 
we're done here...

UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR
---------------------

Run down the hall piece then trot down the steps. Use the double doors 
at the bottom.

DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR
-----------------------

Run forward and down the hall. Dodge the Zombie and go right around the 
corner, where you find some medical supplies -- check the cabinet for a 
DAGGER. Keep going down this hall and take the double doors on the left. 
After you unlock it with your Key for the Power Area, head in.

COLD STORAGE
----------------

Those various "grunts" and "growls" are from the Chimera enemy, which 
basically looks like a skinned human with many insect limbs. They're 
dangerous only if you're not prepared, but I just told you, so you are 
prepared. :p Run forward and push that shelf unit forward. To your left 
collect the SHOTGUN SHELLS on the shelf, and climb up on the ledge to 
your right. Examine (press A) against that hole high up on the wall 
(it's an air vent). 

AUTOPSY ROOM
---------------- 

You've climbed through! But don't stick around here unless you like 
being lunch for a Chimera. Run along the countertop to the air vent 
right beside you and climb through.

COLD STORAGE
----------------

Make this QUICK -- Chimeras can pop in through the vent. Hop down from 
the ledge and run along the body bags. On the counter in the corner, 
check it to find another GameCubesque Data Reader -- use an MO Disk to 
green-light another lock on the security door. Flip around, and run 
along the other side of the body bags. Push forward the shelf unit then 
exit out the door on the right.

DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR
-----------------------

Turn to the left and unlock the door in the corner. Discard your Key for 
the Power Area and head through.

BRANCHED HALLWAY
--------------------

Run forward down the hall and take the door straight across.

LAB LOUNGE
--------------

Look at the bag of goodies in this room (no jokes :P )! Grab all the 
stuff waiting for you, especially the INK RIBBON beside the TYPEWRITER. 
I'd SAVE your game if I were you. But if I were you, you'd be me, and 
then I'd use your body to tell you to tell me to save. *goes cross-eyed* 
Use the Inventory Check then leave the room.

BOILER ROOM
--------------- 

You only have to kill ONE Chimera the entire time you're in here. Turn 
to the right (CHRIS' RIGHT!), and run down and round the corner. A 
Chimera is waiting at the other end of this path -- pump him full of 
shells! Run down to where his body should be melting into a pile of gut 
juice and examine the blue light beside the "WARNING" sign. Take out the 
FUEL SUPPLY CAPSULE. It's empty and we need to fill it with fuel! The 
refueler is located in the "Chemistry Research Lab", the room with the 
first GameCubesque Data Reader. Once you backtrack...

CHEMISTRY RESEARCH LAB
--------------------------

From the door head around to the next area and examine that glass door. 
Say "yes" to put in the capsule, causing it to refill with fuel. 

The fuel contains a "nitro compound" -- if you run with it in your 
inventory you will EXPLODE! So walk. WALK. W-A-L-K!!! DO NOT RUN. 

Now •WALK• on back to the Boiler Room...

BOILER ROOM
---------------
Head right again, round the corner, and at the end press A in front of 
the blue light to set the Fuel Supply Capsule in place. We can now go to 
turn on the power. Flip around and run back to the door. From there head 
left, round the corner and run down -- CHIMERA -- use the door. 

BOILER HALLWAY
------------------

The Chimeras are endless! Immediately run STRAIGHT across. At the end 
you find the final GameCubesque Data Reader -- use your last MO Disk. 
Flip around and run back, this time taking the other path. Follow this 
path and RUN THE WHOLE TIME, those Chimeras will take you down if you're 
not careful. Use the double doors.

POWER ROOM
--------------

Even more Chimeras! Take either path and follow the catwalk around. In 
the back you find an alcove -- examine the console in it and say "yes" 
to turn on the power to the elevator. Now RUN back to the door! Exit, 
and you just need to backtrack to the "Branched Hallway."

BRANCHED HALLWAY
--------------------

Run forward, go up the steps, and take the door on the side.

LAB LOUNGE
--------------

Back in the save room; save your game and prepare for the MOTHER of all 
battles! Heal yourself so your health is in the "fine" condition. Now 
load up with:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            Inventory Check
------------------------------------------------------------------------

• Magnum Revolver
• Magnum Rounds
• First Aid Spray

• EMPTY

------------------------------------------------------------------------


                         Ready? Leave the room...

BRANCHED HALLWAY
--------------------

Head right and run down to the end -- here's the elevator. Examine the 
console on the right side of it to bring it up to you. Rebecca catches 
Chris just as he's about to go down...no! How could you do this to me 
Capcom? After I patiently played those underground caves!

BIOHAZARD HALLWAY
---------------------

Go around the corner and use that spiffy futuristic door. It makes a 
"whoosh" like in Star Wars!

BIO-ORGANIC WEAPONS LABORATORY
----------------------------------

Watch the long-ass (yet INTERESTING) cutscenes. Everything is explained; 
Wesker, the Mansion, the strange creatures, Umbrella Corporation, ect. 
But the best part is that Rebecca gets shot! YES YES! *laughs 
maniacally* Afterwards Wesker releases the 'Tyrant' from its water tube. 
Except Tyrant is a bit cranky and decides to skewer Wesker with his 
claw, causing a fountain of blood to spurt out. Just one of the perks of 
a Chris game! Tyrant's awake. He's pissed. And he's after Chris...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          FINAL BOSS -- Tyrant 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This battle is much easier if you can use the layout of the lab to your 
advantage! Here's some ascii to help you:

           '------------------------------------------------'


"C" is where Chris starts out, and "T" is where Tyrant is. The key is to 
keep your distance from Tyrant, and not get trapped in either dead end 
with the door or the Electronic-Lock Console. Use your Magnum rounds to 
take him down. Fire some ammo, run, fire again, run -- keep repeating 
the process while making laps around the block of Cryo Tanks (which by 
the way, look like they're housing Tyrant's cousins). After Tyrant 
"dies" (snicker) he'll fall over.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go visit the disemboweled Wesker in the corner to get a precious 
"Observation Note" file. Everyone always misses that one! Now check 
Rebecca...aw crap, she was wearing a bullet-proof vest! (Wesker also 
disappears). Head over to the Electronic Lock Console and examine it to 
unlock the door. Take the door and exit out...

BIOHAZARD HALLWAY
---------------------

Head around the corner and ride the elevator up again.

BRANCHED HALLWAY
--------------------

Round the corner...Rebecca pipes up that she found a "Self Destruct 
System" earlier and we need to use it to stop the spread of the virus. 
After she runs ahead, turn right at the fork and run down. Use the door.

DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR
-----------------------

As Chris dashes ahead, the Self Destruct System is activated! Chimeras 
are coming out of the air vents, so RUN forward, then turn right at the 
corner and run down. Take the double doors off to the LEFT.

PATIENT HALLWAY
-------------------

Purdy lights. *has seizure* Head all the way to the other end -- the 
Security Door; if you used all three of the MO Disks on the GameCubesque 
Data Readers, then all three lights on the lock will be green. Press 
down all three of the levers. Head through the unlocked door...

HIDDEN CORRIDOR 
------------------- 

Run down the stairs and go around the corner. Open the door.

JILL'S PRISON CELL
----------------------

Sure the toilet is bad, and the bed is filthy, but at least there's no 
cellmate named Tina. :p Jill is rescued, and the two of you leave. 

HIDDEN CORRIDOR
-------------------

Don't move, just turn yourself around and enter the cell again.

JILL'S PRISON CELL
----------------------

Aha! Been holding out on us? Grab the SHOTGUN SHELLS beside the bed. OK, 
now you're done here and can leave.

HIDDEN CORRIDOR
-------------------

Go around the corner and run up the stairs. Use the door.

PATIENT HALLWAY
-------------------

Follow Jill to the other end of the hall and use the double doors.

DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR
-----------------------

Take the double doors right beside you.

UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR
---------------------

Run up the staircase and flip around, running parallel to the stairs. 
Round the corner and use the door at the end.

LAB ENTRANCE
---------------

Heal yourself, stock up on supplies, and SAVE YOUR GAME. Don't save if 
you want to fight the first Tyrant again! Use the ladder beside you...

MACHINERY ROOM
------------------

Run forward, where you find Jill waiting for you. Use the huge metal 
door that's now open due to the self-destruct sequence.

MACHINERY HALLWAY
---------------------

Ignore the goodies laying on the floor -- some FIRST AID BOX and SHOTGUN 
SHELLS -- because you need ONE space open in your inventory. Run along 
the catwalk all the way to the end, where you should grab that small box 
thing, the FUSE UNIT. Head around the corner and check the alcove beside 
the elevator. Place in the Fuse Unit, restoring the power to the 
elevator and also triggering a cutscene. Rebecca catches up, but some 
Chimeras are following you, so Jill and Rebecca go to hold them off. 
Chris makes his way up the elevator.

                      A timer of 3 minutes appears.

HELIPORT
------------

After you reach the top, grab that large gray case sitting on the 
ground, some SIGNAL ROCKETS. Immediately use them where you stand, and 
Chris will run to the center of the Helipad and shoot them off to signal 
Brad in the helicopter. Nearby the elevator comes back up, delivering 
Jill and Rebecca. Tyrant -- INCOMING!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                FINAL BOSS -- Tyrant, the FINAL battle!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This guy really isn't too difficult, especially as Chris Redfield, since 
his increased stamina allows you to survive SEVERAL "super attacks" from 
Tyrant without needing to heal. Use Magnum rounds or Shotgun Shells to 
take him out. Just make sure you let Rebecca distract the Tyrant. With 
Tyrant's back to you, you can get off a full clip of Magnum rounds 
before he even notices. Hey, and he might even kill Rebecca by skewering 
her, making it worthwhile after all LOL (seriously though, if she gets 
killed, start over, as you will get a worse ending). 

If Tyrant starts pacing slowly at you -- WATCH IT! He will soon run full 
speed and attempt to do a powerful bitch-slap attack which can take off 
about 1/3 of your health. Run perpendicular to him to dodge.

After doing enough damage to Tyrant, Brad will actually develop a set of 
balls and drop a ROCKET LAUNCHER down onto the helipad. Pick it up; this 
takes several seconds to grab, so plan accordingly. Now fire a rocket at 
Tyrant -- sometimes he blocks it and you need to shoot again, otherwise 
he'll be blown into little bits of confetti. You 1, Tyrant 0. 


GAME OVER.

Watch the ending (whichever one you got) and the credits. Now beat the

These adorable little things inhabit areas throughout the game. Remember 
to pet...er...plaster a bullet to their forehead as you come across'em. 
Under the strength stat: 5 stars means they're a goliath, while 1 star 
means they're an absolute pansy/push-over.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Cerberus
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


A standard dog who's received massive amounts of the mutanagenic virus. 
They tend to hunt in packs and make a tell-tail "click" sound when 
walking. If they spot you, it's best to zigzag back in forth in 45 
degree angles. A Shotgun will take them out quickly, and if they grab a 
limb on your character rapidly press A and wiggle the control stick to 
throw them off. 

STRENGTH: ***


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Chimera
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Pronounced (KHY - mare - UH). The appropriate way to say it, as it's 
from mythology. :p This thing is really bizarre -- it looks like a cross 
between a skinned human and Gorilla, with insect limbs jutting out all 
over the place. It inhabits the air vents of the Laboratory and makes 
disturbing grunt sounds. You can kill them if you want (with grenades or 
a shotgun), but they spawn continually...so it's a waste of time. The 
only •one• you ever really need to take out guards the area with the 
Fuel Supply Capsule. But if you want to have a little fun with a Chimera 
(heh), wait for it to crawl up on the ceiling. Next, run directly 
underneath it -- sometimes the thing will pick you up! Your character 
struggles a bit, but ends up using a defense item...

STRENGTH: *****


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Crimson Head
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Dangerous, VERY dangerous! The worse part is how insidious they are. If 
you kill a Zombie, and forget to either burn his body or remove the 
head, the corpse will go in a state of sleep/metamorphosis. Sometime 
later (like when you get a key) the body will resurrect itself as a 
super-zombie Crimson Head. They run as fast as your character and have 
sharp claws in the place of hands which they try to stab you to death 
with. Use a shotgun, run, or better yet, make sure they don't spawn.

STRENGTH: *****


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Crow
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


This giant black bird is perhaps the biggest pest in the game! Just 
ignore them like you would Giant Bees. These guys try to attack you by 
mauling you on the head.

STRENGTH: **


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Giant Bee
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


This massive insect pest travels in small swarms -- don't waste ammo on 
them. However if you actually do manage to shoot them to death, squish 
their bodies on the floor with your shoe to see some green sludge...

STRENGTH: *


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Hunter
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Honestly these guys are very dangerous, but the way they look -- like a 
guy in frog costume -- just doesn't cut it for me. Shotgun blasts work 
wonders; and when they try to lunge/leap at you dodge them or else they 
may deliver a one-hit kill by ripping off your face. You know they're 
dead when they convulse and spasm out like their doing Riverdance on the 
floor.

STRENGTH: ****


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Neptune
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Comes in baby and full-grown varieties. These sharks inhabit the main 
tank of the Aqua Ring. You can stick around and deliver a few Shotgun 
Shells to drop them, or just do the smart thing and RUN. Watch out for 
the Mommy Shark, which can eat you in one bite.

STRENGTH: ***   (Baby)   
          ***** (Mommy)


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Sweeper
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Take a Hunter, turn it's reptilian skin slightly red, and add in the 
inexplicable ability to poison you. Run if you can, but it's better to 
nuke Sweepers with a few grenades.

STRENGTH: *****


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Tarantula
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Also called "Giant Spider" and "What the hell was that?". I don't even 
bother killing these things unless they REALLY get in my way. Use a 
Shotgun or Grenade Launcher to watch their frail bodies rupture and 
spill green bodily fluid everywhere. Watch the poison spit, it's a 
killer!

STRENGTH: ***


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Viper
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


These snakes always find a way to ambush you and ALWAYS travel in 
groups. Ignore'em unless you feel like getting poisoned by their bite. 
And believe me, if you're playing on HARD mode these things will find a 
way to poison you by what seems like telepathy! Bad experiences. :p

STRENGTH: *


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Zombie
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


You better know what this is -- a human who has received the virus and 
is now a lumbering pile of rotting flesh with a taste for blood. They 
take many bullets to die, and instead of just repeating what I've 
already said about them, check the "Survival Tactics" section at the 
beginning of the guide.

     7.  W E A P O N S


========================================================================



=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Survival Knife
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


This has got to be the most useless pieces of crap in the game. When you 
"attack" with it, you execute a wimpy little slash that does barely any 
damage. Don't even think about using it against anything but Zombies, 
and even then it's pathetic because its limited range opens you up for 
attack. Aim for the head, I guess...still a pathetic weapon.

STATS
---------

Slash Rate:  Slow
Power:       Very Low

FOUND
---------

Both Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield have the Survival Knife in their 
inventory at the start of the game. However, you can find an additional 
Survival Knife in the "Spiders' Nest" chamber in the subterranean 
tunnels behind the Courtyard waterfall.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Handgun
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Sturdy and dependable, the Handgun is probably THE weapon used most in 
the game. It has great range, the ammo is fairly plentiful, and its 
great against Zombies and other minor nuisances. The "everyman's gun." 

STATS
---------

Fire Rate:  Fast
Power:      Moderate
Ammo Type:  Handgun Magazine
Capacity:   15 Rounds

FOUND
---------

Jill Valentine starts the game with this in her inventory. Chris 
Redfield finds it shortly after the start of the game, in the Mansion 
Foyer. Apparently left behind when his other team members disappear.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Shotgun
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Though a MAJOR upgrade in power from the Handgun, the ammo is scarcer 
for this guy, so only use it when needed -- like against Hunters, 
Crimson Heads, or Zombie Dogs. Basically anything you want to get rid of 
quickly before they do damage to you. The spread radius from the Shotgun 
shells is an added bonus, since you can hit targets even with slightly 
bad aim.

STATS
---------

Fire Rate:  Slow
Power:      Strong
Ammo Type:  Shotgun Shells
Capacity:   6 Rounds

FOUND
---------

Both Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield get the Shotgun from the "Antique 
Anteroom" in the east side of the Mansion. After removing the weapon, 
two hooks are triggered causing the ceiling to lower in the nearby 
"Quaint Little Room". If you're Jill, just check both doors to have 
Barry save you, but if you're Chris, you need to replace the Shotgun 
with the Broken Shotgun so the trap isn't activated.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Assault Shotgun
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Take the Shotgun, make it hold 10 shots instead of the standard 6, make 
it fire faster, and make it cooler looking -- this is the Assault 
Shotgun! If you have a choice, pick this over the standard model! You 
get this from Richard after he meets an (unhappy) demise.

STATS
---------

Fire Rate:  Moderate
Power:      Very Strong
Ammo Type:  Shotgun Shells
Capacity:   10 Rounds

FOUND
---------

Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield get this weapon at two different 
points in the game, THOUGH both require you save Richard with the Serum. 
Jill will get it from Richard in the Mansion "Attic" while fighting Yawn 
the first time. Chris gets it from Richard in the "Shark Enclosure" at 
the Residence. 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Magnum Revolver
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


The hand-held love child of death! Each shot packs a HUGE punch. But due 
to it's slow-fire rate and scare ammo, use against bosses only.

STATS
---------

Fire Rate:  Very Slow
Power:      Extremely Strong
Ammo Type:  Magnum Rounds
Capacity:   6 Rounds

FOUND
---------

On the second floor of the Mansion, enter the "Specimen Lab" that's on 
the East Stairs Hallway. Do the trading sequence to get the Wind Crest 
hidden by the panel in the wall. Once you reach the Courtyard, you'll 
find a "Forest Graveyard" enroute to the Cabin. Examine the main 
tombstone on the right and place in the Wind Crest to get a Moon Crest, 
Star Crest, and Sun Crest. Use them on the opposite tombstone to get the 
revolver.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Barry's 44 Magnum
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


A major upgrade in power from the standard Magnum -- it comes with 6 
shots and you get no EXTRA ammo. Use against Tyrant for maximum 
effect...and hilarity, as Tyrant drops like a sack of potatoes. 

STATS
---------

Fire Rate:  Very Slow
Power:      MASSIVELY Powerful
Ammo Type:  NONE
Capacity:   6 Rounds

FOUND
---------

This is a Jill Valentine-only weapon. Barry leaves it behind in "The 
Tomb" at the Altar area after he gets knocked in the pit by Lisa, IF you 
said "no" to giving him his gun back. 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Grenade Launcher
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


When the job calls for some serious firepower, except no substitute. If 
one shot doesn't kill them, it will at least stun them for a moment 
allowing you some breathing room. Use this against bosses, and enemies 
that just wouldn't die.  

The Grenade Launcher, along with having normal (gray) rounds, also has 
two types of special ammo.

• Incendiary Shells (red). More powerful then normal rounds, and they
  are able to set things on fire. So if you say, take out a Crimson Head
  with these things there's no need to worry about burning his body.  

• Acid Shells (green). As powerful (or more so) as Incendiary Shells,
  yet they also have a bonus -- the shells are filled with sulfuric
  acid, allowing them to continue to a burn a target long after they
  have made contact. 

STATS
---------

Fire Rate:  Moderate
Power:      MASSIVELY Powerful
Ammo Type:  Grenade Shells, Incendiary Shells, Acid Shells
Capacity:   Unlimited

FOUND
---------

Only Jill Valentine can find this lovely tool; it's on the second floor 
"Garden Balcony" which you use your Armor Key to access. The weapon is 
sitting by Forest's dead body.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Flamethrower
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Oh boy does this weapon SUCK, and it's even more a shame because this is 
like the "Grenade Launcher equivalent" for Chris Redfield. You only get 
it about five minutes (as it's used as a switch trigger), and it has 
limited ammo -- you start out with "100%" and when it reaches "0%" 
you're done. The flame spurts produced are for close range fighting 
ONLY. You can use it against the Queen Spider, but that's it...

STATS
---------

Fire Rate:  Moderate
Power:      Moderate
Ammo Type:  NONE
Capacity:   100%

FOUND
---------

Well, in the subterranean tunnels underneath the Courtyard, you find the 
Flamethrower sitting on some hooks on the wall in the tunnel before the 
Spiders' Nest. Then you have to place the Flamethrower on some more 
hooks after the nest to unlock the door to continue. All in all you have 
the weapon about 5 minutes...


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Rocket Launcher
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


The most powerful weapon in the entire game, bar none, but the problem 
is you only get it in the last few minutes of the game. Comes with four 
rockets, but it only takes one to beat the final boss, Tyrant, and blow 
him into colorful confetti pieces.

STATS
---------

Fire Rate:  Very Slow
Power:      INSTANT KILL
Ammo Type:  NONE
Capacity:   4 Rounds

FOUND
---------

At the very end of the game, if you fighting the second battle with 
Tyrant, Brad will drop the Rocket Launcher onto the Helipad. Use it to 
destroy Tyrant.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Self defense gun
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


This tiny gun is a .22 Magnum. It's capable of firing two rounds, though 
one of the bullets has already been spent when you find it. Use it 
against Plant 42 for heavy damage, or Tyrant at the end of the game. 
Just don't waste the single bullet on stupid things!

STATS
---------

Fire Rate:  Moderate
Power:      Very Strong
Ammo Type:  NONE
Capacity:   1 Round

FOUND
---------

In the Residence, in Room 001 (the place with the guy who hung himself). 
You find the Self defense gun on the desk beside the bed. It also comes 
with a "Suicide Note" file...I think we know where the other bullet 
went! Heh...


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Dagger
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


A weak defense item, the Dagger causes your character to stab a Zombie 
in the head when it grabs them, allowing you to break free. 

POWER: Moderate


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Stun Gun
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


VERY strong defense item, and exclusive to Jill Valentine. After a 
Zombie grabs you, Jill will shock'em with this causing the Zombie's body 
to flash and go into paralysis. It might even (re)kill them in one shot. 
You have to find Battery Packs to charge the Stun Gun. 

POWER: Very Strong


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Flash Grenade
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Literally the best defense item, PERIOD! And it is so much fun to use! 
:p After Chris is attacked by a Zombie, he'll jam one of these in its 
mouth. RUN FOR COVER! In a few seconds, a huge explosive will ensue, 
blowing the Zombie's head to bits and killing it...for good. If you're 
caught near the Zombie when it explodes, expect to take SERIOUS damage. 
Of course, you can make sure the Zombie blows up faster by firing a 
bullet (which hits the grenade). And another thing, the Flash Grenade is 
so powerful, not only will it kill its target, but also knock over any 
Zombies nearby!

POWER: Instant Kill

                            Trevor's diary

Nov. 24, 1967

Eleven days have past since arriving on this estate. How did I end up 
like this? A guy in a lab coat came with a plate of skimpy meal and said 
to me, "Sorry to put you through this, but it's for security reasons." 
That's when it hit me. It all makes sense now.

There are only two people that know the secret of this mansion, Sir 
Spencer and myself. If they kill me, Sir Spencer will be the only person 
that knows the secret. But for what purpose? It doesn't matter now. It's 
too dangerous here. My family...I hope they are all right.

I've decided to escape...
Jessica, Lisa, I pray you are safe.

Nov. 26, 1967

How could I be so careless? I lost my favorite lighter -- the one 
Jessica gave me for my birthday. Now it's going to be that much harder 
to get out of this dark place.

Nov. 13, the date when my fate was sealed. My aunt was hospitalized just 
three days before that. Jessica and Lisa said that they were going to 
visit her. I wish I could be there with them.

But wait, even as I'm writing my memory is coming back to me more 
vividly. Just before I passed out, I remember the men in the lab coats 
said something like "Most likely your family is already..." I pray for 
their safety.

Nov. 27, 1967

Somehow I managed to get out that room. But getting out of this mansion 
won't be as easy. I have to get past all the booby-traps. Tiger Eyes, 
Gold Emblem...I have to try and remember for my own sake...

Nov. 29, 1967

I can't get out. I have tried every possible way to escape but only to 
be faced with the reality that I'm trapped. I've been everywhere. The 
laboratory with the large glass tubes filled with formaldehyde and those 
dark, wet and errie caves... What can I do?

At first I didn't want to believe my eyes. But that familiar high-heeled 
shoe in the corridor... It was like reflex. One name came to my mind, 
Jessica! I don't want to believe they share the same fate as me.

No! I can't give up hope. I have to hope they're alive.

Nov. 30, 1967

I haven't had anything to eat or drink for the past few days. I feel 
like I'm going crazy. Why is this happening to me? Why do I have to die 
like this?

I was too obsessed with designing this ghastly mansion. I should have 
known better.

Nov. 31, 1967

It was a dark and damp underground tunnel. And another dead end. But 
even in the darkness something caught my eye. Carefully, I lit the last 
match I had to see what it was. A grave! But deeply engraved into the 
stone was my name!

                            "George Trevor"

At that instant, it all became clear to me. Those bastards knew from the 
beginning that I'd die here and I fell right into their trap. But it's  
too late now. I'm losing it. Everything is becoming so far away.
Jessica... Lisa... Forgive me.

Because of my ego, I got both of you involved in this whole damn 
conspiracy. Forgive me. May God justify my death in exchange for your 
safety.

                                                     George Trevor

There's something handwritten. It's not dated.

Nothing's changed. I never thought that this room I designed as an 
experiment would pay off like this. I can hide here safely for a while, 
because nobody knows about the secret behind this painting. Not even Sir 
Spencer.

Painting of a mansion... in the back of the art room.

LOCATION:  In the Study; you get it when you collect the Dog Whistle.


                            A crumpled memo

Today, Sir Spencer told me to hide something where no one could find it.
Well, I had this idea. I figured if I could somehow have it protected by 
a dangerous animal like the vicious canine that lives here, no one would 
be able to get near it!

As far as I can tell, the mutt is always hanging around the second floor 
balcony on the west side of the terrace, and he ought to come running at 
the sound of a dog whistle.

This is where you come in. The thing is, I reckon you're the only person 
that can get near that damn dog without risking a serious mauling. Which 
means only you can put this collar on him. The object that Sir Spencer 
wants hidden is concealed inside.

You're the only person I can trust with this. Of course, you'll get 
something out of it as well. Remember that certain item that you've 
always wanted to get hold of? Well, in exchange for your services, I 
just might be able to get it for you. This could work out well for both 
of us...

                      --Uses of Medicinal Herbs--

It is a well-known fact that there exist many plants that are credited 
with medicinal healing powers. Since ancient times, mankind has been 
healing wounds and diseases using various plants.

In this book, we will sample three herbs that are a native of the Arklay
Mountains and briefly outline each of their medicinal qualities. Each 
herb as a distinct color and a distinct medicinal quality.

The green herb recovers physical strength. The blue herb neutralizes 
natural toxins. However, the red herb has no real effect by itself. We
have found that mixing green and red herbs results in a magnified 
effect.

We will outline the effects of red herbs when mixed with other herbs 
when we have more data. Meanwhile feel free to experiment on your own, 
for true knowledge is best acquired through own experience.

Special instructions when disposing dead bodies.

We have new information regarding those "beings". They may appear to be 
dead but in fact they are able to come back to life. However, there are 
ways to prevent them from becoming active again. Currently there are two 
known methods to cease their resurrection.

1.  INCINERATION
2.  DESTRUCTION OF THE HEAD

If further methods are discovered, they will be notified immediately.
Meanwhile to those of you who still have the will to live, oil has been 
placed on the first floor of the mansion. Take as much as you need.  
You'll need something to light it with, which you'll need to find by 
yourself.

May 9, 1998

Played poker tonight with Scott and Alias from Security, and Steve from 
Research. Steve was the big winner, but I think he was cheating. 
Scumbag.

May 10, 1998

One of the higher-ups assigned me to take care of a new creature. It 
looks like a skinned gorilla. Feeding instructions were to give it live 
animals. When I threw in a pig, the creature seemed to play with 
it...tearing off the pig's legs and pulling out the guts before it 
actually started eating.

May 11, 1998

At around 5 A.M., Scott woke me up. Scared the shit out of me, too. He 
was wearing a protective suit. He handed me another one and told me to 
put it on. Said there'd been an accident in the basement lab. I just 
knew something like this would happen. Those bastards in Research never 
sleep, even on holiday.

May 12, 1998

I've been wearing the damn space suit since yesterday. My skin's getting 
grimy and feels itchy all over. The goddamn dogs have been looking at me 
funny, so I decided not to feed them today. Screw 'em.

May 13, 1998

Went to the Infirmary because my back is all swollen and feels itchy. 
They put a big bandage on it and told me I didn't need to wear the suit 
anymore. All I wanna do is sleep.

May 14, 1998

Found another big blister on my foot this morning. I ended up dragging 
my foot all the way to the dog's pen. They were quiet all day, which is 
weird. Then I realized some of them had escaped. Maybe this is their way 
of getting back at me for not feeding them for the last three days. If 
anybody finds out, I'll have my head handed to me.

May 16, 1998

Rumors going around that a researcher who tried to escape the estate 
last night was shot. My entire body feels hot and itchy and I'm sweating 
all the time now. I scratched the swelling on my arm and a piece of 
rotten flesh just dropped off. What the hell's happening to me?

May 19, 1998

Fever gone but itchy. Today hungry and eat doggie food.

May 21, 1998

Itchy itchy Scott came ugly face so killed him. Tasty.

                           There is a letter.

June 3, 1998
My dearest Alma,

Let me first apologize for not being able to call you. A man wearing 
sunglasses didn't permit any phone calls. Sorry Alma. I sit here trying 
to think of where to begin, of how to explain in a few simple words all  
that's happened in my life since we last spoke, and already I fail.

I hope this letter finds you well, and that you'll forgive the tangents 
of my pen; this isn't easy for me. Even as I write, I can feel the 
simplest of concepts slipping away, lost to feelings of despair and 
confusion -- but I have to tell you what's in my heart before I can 
rest. Alma, please believe that what I'm telling you is the truth.

The entire story would take hours for me to tell you, and time is short, 
so accept these things as fact: last month there was an accident in the 
lab and the virus we were studying leaked.

All my colleagues who were infected are dead or dying, and the nature of 
the disease is such that those still living have lost their senses. This 
virus robs its victims of their humanity, forcing them to seek out and 
destroy life. Even as I write these words, I can hear them, pressing 
against my door like mindless, hungry animals.

Alma, I have tried to survive only to see you again. But my efforts 
delayed the inevitable; I am infected, and there is no cure for what 
will follow -- except to end my life before I lose the only thing that 
separates me from them.

                            My love for you.

In an hour I'll have entered my eternal sleep where there is peace. 
Please understand. Please know that I'm sorry.

                                                     Martin Crackhorn


NOTE: If you're playing as Jill Valentine, somebody has ripped off the
      top of the letter (Barry probably...) so you can only read the
      bottom part...it is as follows:

"A letter is slipped inside.
The top part of the letter is torn off. The rest of the letter is 
legible.

Alma, I have tried to survive..." And so on like normal.

June 22, 1998

I had to do it. We ran from those things -- helping each other to  
survive. But Robert started to show the symptoms. I had to do it. Those 
damn things are pure evil.

There was no other way. He would have done the same if it were the other 
way around. After I put him out of his misery I had to just leave him in 
the bathroom. Now I'm probably the last one....

How could this happen? I'll never forgive myself for being part of this 
project. Eventually I'll get what's coming to me, though. There's no way 
to escape from this nut house. It's just a matter of time now.

Everything is set. All I need is a little courage to get it done. 
Knowing I'll leave many things undone is regret beyond words. But, this 
is better than just waiting to turn into one of them. Please understand 
and at least let me end my life as a person.

                     There's a message on the back.

                      Linda, please forgive me...

                            Plant 42 Report

LOCATION:  Found in the Residence, in Room 002. The file is laying on
           the desk beside the bed. 


                            PLANT 42 REPORT

Four days have passed since the accident. The plant at Point 42 is 
growing at an amazing rate. Although there are many unknown aspects 
about this plant, we know in comparison with the other group of plants, 
the T-Virus has had a substantially stronger affect on this one.

The T-Virus has drastically morphed its host's anatomy as well as its 
size. Looking at its current state, it's difficult to imagine its 
original appearance. Nowhere on Earth will you find anything like it.

We've also found that PLANT 42 has two main source of acquiring its 
necessary nutrients. One source is through its root. Somehow it has 
rooted itself down into the basement.

Immediately after the accident, a scientist went mad and destroyed the 
Aqua Ring. Ever since, the basement has been like a pool. There is a 
high possibility that it's one of the chemicals in the water that's 
promoting the PLANT 42's rapid growth. However, we have yet to determine 
the specific chemical.

A bulb-like body of the PLANT 42 has been sighted hanging from the 
ceiling of the first floor. We are sure that it used the air ducts to 
reach the first floor. Numerous long tentacle-like vines are protruding 
from the bulb.

We believe the vines are the second means of acquiring its nutrients. 
When the PLANT 42 senses prey, it uses the tentacle-like vines to 
capture its prey. After doing so, suckers on the vine drain the prey of 
its blood.

We've also noticed that it has some intelligence. When it captures its 
prey or when it's inactive, the vines twine around the door to stop 
possible intruders.

Unfortunately, a several of our scientists have already fallen victim to 
this PLANT 42. When we heard the stories from the survivors, they all 
observed one thing in common: When the uniform petal-like flaps open and 
reveal its vital internals, it has a tendency to become more aggressive.

One witness reported that it was as if it was trying to protect itself.  
Why it behaves the way it does is still unknown.

                    Organic Chemistry Lab Experiment

The similarities in the cellular characteristics of the rapidly growing 
plant infected by the Tyrant Virus have been reported in previous 
papers. However, while repeating these experiments, an interesting new 
fact became clear.

We learned that a chemical in the UMB family, UMB No. 20, contains a 
compound that that is toxic to the cells of the plant. We have given UMB 
No. 20 a new name: V-JOLT. If calculations prove correct, when V-JOLT is 
applied directly to the root of the plant, the entire plant should be 
dead within 5 seconds.

The V-JOLT can be made by simply mixing the VP and UMB chemicals in a 
specific ratio. However, extra care must be taken when handling these 
UMB chemicals. They have been known to generate toxic gases if 
mishandled.

The characteristics of each UMB chemical are as follows:

UMB No. 3        red
Yellow-6         yellow
UMB No. 7        green
UMB No. 10       orange
VP-017           blue
V-JOLT           dark brown

I feel dizzy after that shot they gave me. I don't see Mom. Where did 
they take her?
She promised that we would escape together. Did she escape alone and 
leave me behind?

Nov. 15, 1967

I found Mom. We ate together. I was very happy.

But she was a fake. Not my real Mom. Same face but different inside.

Have to find Mom. Have to give face back to mother.

I got Mom's face back.
Nobody can have my Mom except me. I attach her face to me so she doesn't 
go away.
Because Mom sad when I meet her without her face.

                             It's a letter.

To my Lisa,

Day by day I can feel my consciousness drifting further away. The shots 
given to me by men in white clothes made some of mommy's itching go 
away. Today they gave me another shot saying it was "nutrition".

When they give me the shots mommy's can think straight, but mommy's 
shocked and sad because mommy's unable to think of you all the time. 
Mommy's afraid. Afraid of forgetting everything, especially the memories 
of you and daddy... What your faces look like, how we used to be 
together... They're all starting to disappear into somewhere dark in my 
mind.

Oh Lisa, I wish I could touch your face and hold you in my arms right 
now, so that I can hold on to our wonderful memories of you and daddy. 
Lisa we can't stay here and longer. We have to escape!

Listen to me Lisa. Our chance to escape is the next time when we go to 
that lab together. We'll both pretend that we are both unconscious and 
when that man in white clothes is off guard that will be our chance.

When we're on the outside, let's look for daddy together. Okay sweetie? 
Be strong, Lisa.

                          Researcher's letter

June 8th, 1998
My dearest Ada,

By the time you read this letter, I will no longer be the person you 
once knew. The results of my test came out today, and as I suspected, it 
came out positive. I feel like I am teetering on the edge of reason just 
thinking about my impending doom. I would give anything not to have to 
become one of them.

As far as I know, you are not infected. I sincerely hope things do not 
reach such a desperate pass, but if it has turned out that you are now 
the last person remaining alive, I want you to get the material from the 
Visual Data Room.

Then, activate the Self-Destruct System in the Power Room, and escape 
from here. Please do everything in your power to make this whole 
accident public.

If everything is still running normally, you should be able to release 
all the locks using the Security System. I have set up the terminal in 
the small security room so that you can log in to the system using my 
name and your name as the password.

You will need another password to release the lock of the door in 
Basement Level Two where the Visual Data Room is located. As a safety 
measure I have coded that password into an X-ray picture; a 
roentgenogram. I know you, and I'm sure you will be able to work it out 
without any trouble.

There is just one more thing...and it's my last request. I hope you 
never have to lay eyes on me in this state, but if you do happen to run 
into me in my hideous form, I beg you to put me out of my misery. I hope 
you understand.

Thank you, Ada.
Yours truly,

John

                            Researcher's note

There is now evidence that when the host loses consciousness, the body 
goes into a dormant state. During this time the virus becomes active and 
rapidly transforms and reconstructs the basic composition of the body.  
The host eventually mutated into a humanoid creature. (We call them V-
ACTs)

Already four of our researchers have died from trying to feed it, 
turning the place into an instant blood bath. (Ever since this tragic 
and barbaric accident, we have decided to call its kind "Crimson 
Heads").

That dangerous and precious prototype specimen can't be left there. We 
have to figure out a way to deal with it. Termination is definitely not 
an option. We finally decided to freeze the specimen and confine the 
body inside the basement of the backyard cemetery.

to any third party is strictly forbidden by the sender. After reading 
the contents of this fax, must be destroyed immediately.

We expect significant increase in the damage done by the recent T-Virus'
outbreak than initially estimated. There are several concerns.

First concern
More than half of the researchers have been infected by the T-Virus and 
died. It has also been reported that almost all of the survivors of this 
accident are starting to show symptoms of the T-Virus infection.

Second concern
Our Secret Security Patrol Team has also been completely eradicated. 
Therefore, our most secret research is in danger of public disclosure.
Quick actions are demanded to prevent mass media coverage.

Third concern
There is a high possibility that most of the specimens are running loose 
inside the compound. We expect many casualties to follow. However yet 
unfortunate, these casualties underscore the success our research 
results. Actions must be taken to prevent our research results from 
being made public.

We suspect the first official intervention will come from the State 
Police and S.T.A.R.S. We strongly recommend taking measures against them 
first.

administration of the primogenitor virus.

The "Prototype Parasite" which we had delivered from a laboratory in 
France was administered to the sample specimen. The sample specimen took 
in the parasite without showing any signs of adverse reaction.

The lack of any reaction was an unsolved mystery. But now everything is 
clear to me now. The "Prototype Parasite" was incubating in the sample 
specimen's body for 21 years. Then from that incubating state the 
prototype suddenly mutated. ("Evolved" may be a more appropriate word to 
describe it.)

This observation gave me more insight in my research. Through further 
modification and testing, I was able to derive a method to create the 
"G" that surpasses the performance of the "T". This was the breakthrough 
that would change the future of the B.O.W.'S history.

I can't wait to see the look on Alexia's annoying face when I finally 
announce my research. But unfortunately I'll have to wait a few more 
years to completely verify my findings.

     9.  F R E Q U E N T L Y   A S K E D   Q U E S T I O N S


========================================================================



Question:  What is a general outline of a typical game?

Answer:  Mansion, Courtyard, Residence, Mansion, Courtyard, Mansion,
         Altar, and Laboratory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  What are the differences between EASY and NORMAL mode?

Answer:  Well, on easy, there are more ammo clips and Ink Ribbon, less
         Zombies, and each Zombie is slower and takes off less damage.
         The bosses are also pathetic. Basically easy mode is the pansy
         version of the game -- play normal to get full enjoyment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  How many different game endings are there?

Answer:  Six. Collect'em all!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  What is the Wooden Mount for?

Answer:  Use it to get a "2F Mansion Map"! Grab it, then head to that
         room with the fireplace at the other end of the East Stairs
         Hallway. Light the fireplace with your Lighter, then use the
         Wooden Mount and your character will place it on the metal
         plate -- scorching in a map outline due to the heat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  What are the locations of the three "MO Disks" and what do
           they do?

Answer:  MO Disks open a special door, which allows you to rescue a
         character and get a SLIGHTLY better ending. I always thought it
         was a waste of time! When you find a MO Disk, place it in a
         GameCubesque Data Reader in the Laboratory.

DISK 1 -- Get the Yellow Gemstone in the Eagle Room of the Mansion. Use
          the gemstone in the Tiger Altar Room to get the disk.

DISK 2 -- In the first hallway of the Laboratory. It's off to the left
          of the stairs sitting on a pile of debris.

DISK 3 -- In the Visual Data Room (room with projector) in the
          Laboratory. Sitting on the shelf just right of the entry door.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  What are these "Naked Zombies" people talk about?

Answer:  If you play the game on normal or hard, you get to see some
         white-skinned Zombies that run around naked in a few areas of
         the Laboratory. It's worth buying Resident Evil just for that! 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  HELP! I'm out of defense items, out of healing items, have
           red/danger health, and am surrounded by Zombies!

Answer:  Pop one of them in the legs a few times to quickly drop'em so
         you can bowl on through -- otherwise say g'night. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  I'm at the Residence, and playing as Chris. When I try to
           make the J-VOLT in the lab, it says I need somebody who knows
           how to work with medical equipment... 

Answer:  That's because you have to get Rebecca to make the J-VOLT for
         you! But she •wouldn't• make it if you saved Richard in time
         with the Serum in the Mansion. It doesn't really matter, using
         the J-VOLT while playing as Chris is a waste of time since you
         have to fight Plant 42 anyway.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  What happens if you use the Red Gemstone on the Tiger Statue
           in the small altar room?

Answer:  Something...bad. :p You're supposed to only use the Yellow and
         Blue Gemstones, but if you accidentally use the red one, here's
         what happens: The statue convulses, then raises into the
         ceiling. A short time later, a HUGE mass of Vipers rains down
         from the ceiling...if you exit the room and come back, you'll
         find your Red Gemstone laying on the floor. Creepy. You have to
         see this at least once!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  What happens if I open the "front door", i.e. the door at the
           front of the Mansion Foyer?

Answer:  Some Cerberus are waiting for you on the porch and one of them
         will manage to pop in for a visit...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  What's this "infinite Grenade Launcher ammo trick"?

Answer:  See any other FAQ yah cheating bastard! I honestly don't see
         how you can call yourself a real player when you use this trick
         to get through the game -- EVEN if you're doing a speed run.
         "Look Mommy, I got a time of 45 minutes! I'm special and used
         eleventy billion grenades! Hyuk hyuk! Der." It would be one
         thing if it was, say, a secret code, but it's nothing but a
         glitch overseen by the programmers!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  I died on Hard Mode REALLY quickly! Any tips?!

Answer:  Ding ding! Junior here found out that hard mode was actually
         (wait for it) HARD! See the appropriate FAQs...I recommend
         marshmallow's "Chris Hard Mode Walkthrough".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  How do I kill Lisa Trevor? I've tried everything.

Answer:  She's invincible. Maybe that's part of the problem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  I talked to Barry, and in the guide it says you get Acid
           Shells from him. But I didn't get ANY!

Answer:  That's because you need an open space in your inventory you
         dunce.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  When a Zombie grabs you, especially from behind, anyway to
           minimize the damage? 

Answer:  Rapidly press A and roll the control stick back and forth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  What's the best way to dodge a Cerberus?

Answer:  Run back and forth in 45 degree angles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  I'm poisoned, and in the Mansion. Where's the Blue Herbs?

Answer:  There is a Blue Herb Terrace. To find it, you must get to the
         "Wardrobe Room." From the Mansion Foyer, unlock the single door
         on the right with your Helmet Key. Head through this room and
         you're at the Wardrobe Room.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  How do I get the Shotgun as Chris Redfield?

Answer:  Remember the Broken Shotgun you got in the side closet near the
         West Stairs save room? Do the switch-a-roo and there yah go... 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  What should I use the Self defense gun on?

Answer:  Try the Plant 42 or Tyrant.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  Playing as Jill, I tried to get the Shotgun but got crushed
           in the room with the lowering ceiling. What went wrong? 

Answer:  Did you remember to check BOTH DOORS so that way Barry saves
         you? That was in the guide you know!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  Should I give Barry his gun back?

Answer:  *cries* It's in the guide...I typed...it...so beautiful. Mommy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  Is Lisa Trevor invincible? Because I can't kill her...

Answer:  Wait a second! Didn't I just answer that? Arg!!!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  In the "Keeper's Diary" file when he referred to the
           "skinless Gorilla", was he talking about a Hunter or a
           Chimera?

Answer:  ...I like cake. And cheese. But especially Cheesecake!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  Where's the Sword Key? 

Answer:  It's in the guide! Graveyard. Yard with graves? In the back of
         the Book of Curse! Do you know what a book is? That helps!

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Game endings are based upon two factors:

(1) Whether your "partner" stays alive till the end; Barry/Rebecca. 
(2) If you save the other character trapped in the Prison Cell in the
    Laboratory, using the three MO Disks to unlock the door. 


BARRY VARIBLES:
-------------------

1# -- While you're in "The Tomb" at the Altar area, a fight with Lisa
      Trevor ensues. Give the gun back to Barry? "Yes" lets Barry live,
      while "no" ensures he plummets to his doom.

2# -- During the second fight with Tyrant, you can either ignore the
      battle and let Tyrant skewer Barry to death or supply enough
      firepower to keep Tyrant at bay.


REBECCA VARIBLES:
---------------------

1# -- When trying to access the "Spencers' Room" with the Emblem Key,
      Rebecca screams upstairs in the Study. She's being attacked by a
      Hunter. Save her and she lives...ignore her and she dies.

2# -- During the second fight with Tyrant, you can either ignore the
      battle and let Tyrant skewer Rebecca to death or supply enough
      firepower to keep Tyrant at bay.

                             Jill Valentine
                    =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=


BEST   -- Give Barry his gun back, make sure he lives, and rescue Chris
          Redfield. Jill, Barry, and Chris all escape in the helicopter.
          The Mansion explodes.

Good   -- Give Barry his gun back, make sure he dies, and rescue Chris
          Redfield. Jill and Chris escape in the helicopter. The Mansion
          explodes.

Good   -- Give Barry his gun back, make sure he lives, and don't rescue
          Chris Redfield. Jill and Barry escape in the helicopter. The
          Mansion explodes.

Decent -- Give Barry his gun back, make sure he dies, and don't rescue
          Chris Redfield. Jill escapes in the helicopter. The Mansion
          explodes.

Bad    -- Don't give Barry his gun back, and rescue Chris Redfield. Jill
          and Chris escape in the helicopter. The Mansion doesn't
          explode, allowing the T-virus and Tyrant to survive.

WORST  -- Don't give Barry his gun back, and don't rescue Chris. Jill
          escapes in the helicopter. The Mansion doesn't explode,
          allowing the T-virus and Tyrant to survive.

          rescue Jill Valentine. Chris, Rebecca, and Jill all escape in
          the helicopter. The Mansion explodes.

Good   -- Rescue Rebecca from the Hunter, make sure she dies, and rescue
          Jill Valentine. Chris and Jill escape in the helicopter. The
          Mansion explodes.

Good   -- Rescue Rebecca from the Hunter, make sure she lives, and don't
          rescue Jill Valentine. Chris and Rebecca, escape in the

          Valentine. Chris and Jill escape in the helicopter. The
          Mansion doesn't explode, allowing the T-virus and Tyrant to
          survive.

WORST  -- Don't rescue Rebecca from the Hunter and don't rescue Jill.
          Chris escapes in the helicopter. The Mansion doesn't explode,
          allowing the T-virus and Tyrant to survive.

                    =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=


Kaboom! -- Get to the second Tyrant battle and allow the timer of 3
           minutes to run out. They'll have to scrape your carcass off
           the nearby forest!

Pool of Blood -- Just have your character die and you get a "You Are
                 Dead" screen. Not much of an ending, I know!

Once Again...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


HOW TO EARN:  Beat the game just one time.

Refers to any game you play from the puke-green starting screen. The 
screen also allows you to continue to unlock new features. 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Hard
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


HOW TO EARN:  This extra difficulty level is listed under a "Once
              Again..." game.

Beating this gives you some SERIOUS bragging rights. A lot of the Ink 
Ribbon and ammo pieces are removed from the game, Zombies are faster and 
more aggressive, and the bosses take a TON of punishment to bring down. 
Your herb supply is also cut in half. I love this mode!


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Real Survival
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


HOW TO EARN:  Beat a "Once Again..." game on either normal or hard, and
              in under 3 hours.

Oh boy...only try this mode if you're •really• patient and dedicated to 
the game. Real Survival is set on HARD MODE, but Capcom also throws in a 
few new challenges -- auto-aim is turned off and the Item Boxes AREN'T 
linked. This means whatever item you put in one box, you must go BACK to 
the same box to get it. This mode is a total nightmare with Chris...but 
I've beaten it that way! Muah! :p 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Invisible Enemy
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


HOW TO EARN:  (1) Beat "Real Survival" mode once.
              (2) Beat a "Once Again..." game on either normal or hard,
                  with BOTH Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield.

A very fun way to play the game, this mode makes all the enemies (you 
guessed it) invisible! The bosses are also invisible, which isn't pretty
when you factor in that Mega Crimson Head waiting in the Graveyard. 
Auto-aim is also disabled so you're on your own!

                      H I D D E N   W E A P O N S
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Here are two sweet pieces of hardware you can add to your arsenal...


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Samurai Edge
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


HOW TO EARN:  Beat a "Once Again..." game on either normal or hard, and
              in under 5 hours.

This weapon is an upgraded version of the standard S.T.A.R.S. Handgun, 
which has unlimited ammo and fires in three-bullet spurts before 
pausing. Each round also tends to pack a bit more punch...


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Rocket Launcher
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


HOW TO EARN:  Beat a "Once Again..." game on either normal or hard, and
              in under 3 hours.

The ULTIMATE weapon, though I don't use it much...which is ironic since 
it took so much effort to get and I used it a bunch in the beginning. I 
mainly stopped with it because using it makes the game easier than tic-
tac-toe. It has unlimited ammo and each round is a "fire-and-forget" 
rocket which instantly kills almost any enemy (or at least blasts them 
back). 


------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         E A S T E R   E G G S
------------------------------------------------------------------------


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Additional Screen
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Beat the game just once to access a new puke-green starting screen. Much 
better then the original I think! To get the screen again, just load 
your "CLEAR" game. 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Hidden Costumes
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Both Jill and Chris have some extra costumes; AKA the clothes they wear. 
Beat the game with either character one time to rechieve a fancy metal 
and ivory "Closet Key". When you start a new game with that same 
character, you can find the Closet Key in the ITEM BOX. 

Use the key on a hidden door: 

• In the central Mansion Foyer, head to the ground floor. Take the
  double doors on the RIGHT.

• In this "Statue Anteroom" use the side tunnel.

• Head down the tunnel, and in the first corner you should notice that
  large painting of the Mansion on its side. Use the key on this "door"!

Now you get to try on a new costume from the racks of clothes. How nice, 
they even included a mirror. After all, when being attacked by a flesh-
eating mutated dog trying to gouge your eyeballs out, you should always 
look your best!


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
One Dangerous Zombie
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


HOW TO EARN:  Beat a "Once Again..." game on either normal or hard, with
              BOTH Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield.

Not really too much per say, but throughout the beginning of the game 
when you're in the Mansion, your old S.T.A.R.S teammate Forest (the guy 
you got the Grenade Launcher from) has come back to LIFE as a Zombie and 
is chasing you. The real trick is, he's covered in GRENADES -- shoot 
him, use your knife, or use a defense item...KABOOM!!! Say goodnight! 


• Forest takes the place of many Zombies, but in a few instances he
  actually acts as an EXTRA Zombie.

• The Forest Zombie makes a particular "scream" that's a higher pitch
  then your normal undead fellows. 

• "Clinking" happens as he runs due to the grenades covering his body.

• He runs about the same speed as your character! 

• Once the Hunters are activated in the Mansion by you completing the
  Residence, Forest will disappear with the rest of the Zombies.


You can't turn this feature on or off, it just gets added in after you
meet the game's conditions. And if you want to learn ALL about this 
feature in copious detail, see GForce9x's guide at:

http://db.gamefaqs.com/console/gamecube/file/resident_evil_one_dangerous
_zombie.txt

Shinji Mikami Memo
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


HOW TO EARN:  Beat an "Invisible Enemy" game, and in under 5 hours.

Most players will NEVER get to see this! But if you meet the time 
requirement, at the end you rechieve an inspirational (some would say 
psychotic) message from Shinji Mikami, the creator of the Resident Evil 
series. You want too know what it says...?

...something interesting. Hoho. ;)


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Costume Catalogue
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


HOW TO EARN:  Beat an "Invisible Enemy" game, and in under 5 hours.

Along with getting a memo from Mikami-boy, you also get to see a 
catalogue of all costume ideas -- used AND unused. Some you wish they 
hadn't taken out, while others will make you cringe. They should have 
had a "John Travolta disco-inferno" suit. :p


------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          S P E E D   T I P S
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Since I've mentioned a bunch of stuff that gets unlocked based on time, 
why not help you with a few tips...


• First off, to get the best time possible you should play as Jill
  Valentine on NORMAL mode. Do not pick hard, since well, it's more
  difficult, and the Zombies slow you down a LOT. And do NOT use Chris.
  Why? Well here's just a few reasons:

    - Jill has the super-handy Grenade Launcher, and Chris does not. The
      launcher will save you a ton of time throughout the game.

    - With the launcher, you can skip getting the Magnum Revolver in the
      Courtyard, thus saving you about ten minutes (you skip getting the
      Wind Crest upstairs, then doing that crest switch-a-roo in the
      graveyard). The Grenades easily compensate for lack of Magnum
      Rounds.

    - Jill is the "Master of Unlocking" meaning she can open up doors
      with her Lock Pick. No need to waste time getting Old Keys.

    - You can get the Shotgun right away since Barry helps you. This
      means you can proceed straight to the balcony to face the
      Cerberus. 

    - Has eight spaces in her inventory. Good for stashing everything.

    - Jill can ACTUALLY play the piano! You don't have to wait for
      stupid ass Rebecca to "practice." 


• Run in straight lines as much as POSSIBLE. Getting caught on walls is
  bad too, but you probably already knew that...

• The less you get injured, the less time you have to squander healing
  yourself. Also grab herbs as you go, DON'T go back for them. 

• Skip ALL cinema scenes, namely by pressing the "Start/Pause" button
  right at the BEGINNING of them. Some scenes can't be skipped, so just
  press start regardless. In case you're wondering, YES, the game clock
  continues to run while you're watching them. 

• Whenever text is popping up, hit the "A Button" one time to have the
  text pop up a lot faster. You'd be surprised how much time this saves.

• The Status Screen, Pause Screen, Map, and Item Box Screen will NOT
  save your ass when it comes to time. Spend as LITTLE time as possible
  in these places. Only when you hit "game reset" are you safe from the
  omnipresent game clock.

• Skip 95% of the Zombies you come in contact with. This isn't as bad as
  it sounds, because a lot of them disappear after you come back from 
  the Residence...but they're replaced with Hunters. Oh well. ;)

• Need to get around a Zombie quickly? Aim for the legs! Drops them
  faster than Rosie O'Donnell's acting career. 

• Don't bother killing Crows, Giant Bees, Cerberus, ect. Any minor
  enemies you should ignore. You can kill some Hunters though.

• If you mess up BADLY or even MODERATELY, start from your last save.
  You'll thank yourself later. Nothing's worse than being a few minutes
  or seconds short of that Rocket Launcher...

• Kick the crap out of the Plant 42 normal style. SKIP the J-Volt thing!

• Don't give Barry his gun back, that way you skip the second Tyrant
  battle entirely and save a good 5-10 minutes.

Feel free to contact me at my email address: mayonnaise47@yahoo.com.

It's quite frightening, but I seem to be getting more and MORE email 
(along with a greater quantity of crap) everyday. Here's a few things I 
always rechieve...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I get I a question, I will try to answer it as best I can...you may 
get an answer right away, or it might be awhile. And if I happen to not 
answer your question right away, DON'T email me back ten seconds later 
saying "hey, you didn't answer my question!" unless you want me to 
ignore you. If I'm really busy (new video game) I might not even log on 
the internet for a few days.

No questions will be answered that are already answered in the guide. I 
thought that was rather obvious myself, but you'd be surprised. Arf arf. 
If you question is really crappy (i.e. bad grammar, barely decipherable 
english, ect.) I will simply delete it from my inbox...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRAISE LETTERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You mean after I busted my hump you want to complement me? I may not 
reply, but these letters are much appreciated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
HATE LETTERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I've actually gotten these things before. A sad fact when you think 
about it, as I make these guides for free. Some are valid criticism, and 
I will acknowledge those, but others (most) are let's say..."colorful".


Sincerely,
mayonnaise
